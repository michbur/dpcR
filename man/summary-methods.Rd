\title{Methods for Function \code{summary}}
\arguments{
\item{object}{object of class \code{\linkS4class{adpcr}},
\code{\linkS4class{dpcr}} or \code{\linkS4class{qdpcr}}.}

\item{print}{if \code{FALSE}, no output is printed.}
}
\value{
The data frame with estimated values of lambda, m and corresponding
confidence intervals.
}
\description{
Expands function \code{\link[base]{summary}} allowing printing summaries
objects of the class \code{\linkS4class{adpcr}} to or
\code{\linkS4class{dpcr}}.
}
\details{
The function prints a summary of the dPCR reaction, including k (number of
positive chambers), n (total number of chambers), estimated lambda and
concentration, as well as confidence intervals for the
last two variables.
}
\note{
If summary is used on an object containing results of many
experiments, all experiments would be independently summarized. Currently
supported only for objects of class \code{\linkS4class{adpcr}}.

\examples{

# array dpcr
# Simulates a chamber based digital PCR with m total number of template molecules
# and n number of chambers per plate and assigns it as object ptest of the class
# adpcr for a single panel. The summary function on ptest gets assigned to summ
# and the result with statistics according to Dube et al. 2008 and Bhat et al. 2009
# gets printed.
ptest <- sim_adpcr(m = 400, n = 765, times = 5, dube = FALSE, n_panels = 1)
summ <- summary(ptest) # save summary
print(summ)

# multiple experiments
# Similar to the previous example but with five panels
ptest <- sim_adpcr(m = 400, n = 765, times = 5, dube = FALSE, n_panels = 5)
summary(ptest)

# droplet dpcr - fluorescence
# Simulates a droplet digital PCR with m = 7 total number of template molecules
# and n = 20 number of  droplets. The summary function on dropletf gives the
# statistics according to Dube et al. 2008 and Bhat et al. 2009. The fluo parameter
# is used to change the smoothness of the fluorescence curve and the space between
#  two consecutive measured peaks (droplets).
dropletf <- sim_dpcr(m = 7, n = 20, times = 5, fluo = list(0.1, 0))
summary(dropletf)

# droplet dpcr - number of molecules
# Similar to the previous example but with five panels but without and modifications
#  to the peaks.
droplet <- sim_dpcr(m = 7, n = 20, times = 5)
summary(droplet)

# Visualize the results of dropletf and dropletf
# The curves of dropletf are smoother.
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
plot(dropletf, main = "With fluo parameter", type = "l")
plot(droplet, main = "Without fluo parameter", type = "l")
