\title{Digital PCR Analysis}
\description{
The dpcR package is a collection of functions for a digital Polymerase Chain
Reaction (dPCR) analysis. dPCR comprises methods to quantify nucleic acids,
copy number variations (CNV), homo- and heterozygosity, as well as rare mutations
(including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP)). The chemical basis of
dPCR is similar to conventional PCR but the reaction-mix is divided into
hundredths to thousands of small compartments with parallel amplifications
reactions. The analysis is based on counting the number of positive
compartments and relating it to the total number of compartments by means
of Poission statistics which enables an absolute quantification.
}
\details{
The package includes plot functions, summary functions, data sets and simulations 
for dPCR and customizable GUI for droplet digital PCRs and
array-based digital PCRs. We aim to include all
statistical approaches published in peer-review literature and additional
selected sources of expertise currently available. We intent to make these methods 
available to the scientific community in an open and cross-platform environment. Using
the naming convention derived from the MIQE Guidelines for digital PCR, we hope to 
become a reference to a unified nomenclature in dpcR.

The package is primarily targeted at researchers who wish to use it with an existing
technology or during the development of novel digital PCR systems. In
addition the dpcR package provides interactive tools that can be used to 
better learn about digital PCR concepts and data interpretation.
