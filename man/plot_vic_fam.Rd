\title{Amplitude Plot VIC and FAM Channels of a Droplet Digital PCR Experiment}
\usage{
plot_vic_fam(vic, fam, col_vic = "green", col_fam = "blue", circle = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{vic}{Amplitudes of the VIC channel - object of class
\code{\linkS4class{dpcr}}.}

\item{fam}{Amplitudes of the FAM channel - object of class
\code{\linkS4class{dpcr}}.}

\item{col_vic}{Color of the VIC channel.}

\item{col_fam}{Color of the FAM channel.}

\item{circle}{If TRUE circles are drawn, if FALSE not. If "numeric",
specifies the radius of circles.}
}
\description{
This function generates an amplitude plot of two fluorescence channels as
found in droplet digital PCR.
}
\details{
Droplet digital PCR experiments consist of three steps (droplet generation,
clonal amplification, droplet amplitude analysis). Typically 20000
nano-sized droplets are analyzed and separated into amplification-positive
and amplification-negative droplets. An example of such system is the
Bio-Rad QX100 and QX200 (Pinheiro et al. 2012). Such systems have
applications in the detection of rare DNA target copies, the determination
of copy number variations (CNV), detection of mutation, or expression
analysis of genes or miRNA. Each droplet is analyzed individually using a
virtual two-color detection system. The channels are treated separately but
finally aligned (e.g., FAM and VIC or FAM and HEX).

\examples{

# Generate an amplitude plot for the first fluorescence channel (e.g., FAM)
fluos1 <- sim_dpcr(
  m = 16, n = 30, times = 100, pos_sums = FALSE, n_exp = 1,
  fluo = list(0.1, 0)
)

# Generate an amplitude plot for the second fluorescence channel (e.g., VIC)
fluos2 <- sim_dpcr(
  m = 16, n = 30, times = 100, pos_sums = FALSE, n_exp = 1,
  fluo = list(0.1, 0)
)

# Plot the amplitudes of both fluorescence channel in an aligned fashion
plot_vic_fam(fam = fluos1, vic = fluos2)

# Same as above but different colors
plot_vic_fam(fam = fluos1, vic = fluos2, col_vic = "red", col_fam = "yellow")

# Same as above without circles
plot_vic_fam(fam = fluos1, vic = fluos2, col_vic = "red", col_fam = "yellow", circle = FALSE)

# Generate two channels in one object and plot them
fluos_both <- sim_dpcr(
  m = 16, n = 30, times = 100, pos_sums = FALSE, n_exp = 2,
  fluo = list(0.1, 0)
)
plot_vic_fam(extract_run(fluos_both, 1), extract_run(fluos_both, 2))
