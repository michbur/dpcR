\title{Limit Cy0 values}
\usage{
limit_cq(
  data,
  cyc = 1,
  fluo = NULL,
  Cq_range = c(1, max(data[cyc])),
  model = l5,
  SDM = TRUE,
  pb = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a dataframe containing the qPCR data.}

\item{cyc}{the column containing the cycle data. Defaults to first column.}

\item{fluo}{the column(s) (runs) to be analyzed. If \code{NULL}, all runs will be
considered (equivalent of \code{(1L:ncol(data))[-cyc]}).}

\item{Cq_range}{is a user defined range of cycles to be used for the
determination of the Cq values.}

\item{model}{is the model to be used for the analysis for all runs. Defaults
to 'l5' (see \code{\link[qpcR]{pcrfit}}).}

\item{SDM}{if \code{TRUE}, Cq is approximated by the second derivative
method.  If \code{FALSE}, Cy0 method is used instead.}

\item{pb}{if \code{TRUE}, progress bar is shown.}
}
\value{
A data frame with two columns and number of rows equal to the number
of runs analyzed. The column \code{Cy0} contains calculated Cy0 values. The
column \code{in.range} contains adequate logical constant if given Cy0 value
is in user-defined \code{Cq_range}.
}
\description{
Calculates the Cq values of a qPCR experiment
within a defined range of cycles. The function can be used to extract Cq
values of a chamber based qPCR for conversion into a dPCR experiment. All Cq
values are obtained by Second Derivative Maximum or by Cy0 method (Guescini
et al. (2008)).
}
\details{
The \code{Cq_range} for this function an be defined be the user. The default
is to take all amplification curves into consideration. However, under
certain circumstances it is recommended to define a range. For example if
amplifications are positive in early cycle numbers (less than 10).

Approximated second derivative is influenced both by how often interpolation
takes place in each data interval and by the smoothing method used. The user
is encouraged to seek optimal parameters for his data himself. See
\code{\link[chipPCR]{inder}} for details.

The calculation of the Cy0 value (equivalent of Cq) is based on a
five-parameter function. From experience this functions leads to good
fitting and avoids overfitting of critical data sets. Regardless, the user
is recommended to test for the optimal fitting function himself (see
\code{\link[qpcR]{mselect}} for details).

\examples{

library(qpcR)
test <- cbind(reps[1L:45, ], reps2[1L:45, 2L:ncol(reps2)], reps3[
  1L:45,
  2L:ncol(reps3)
])

# results.dPCR contains a column with the Cy0 values and a column with
# converted values.
Cq.range <- c(20, 30)
ranged <- limit_cq(
  data = test, cyc = 1, fluo = NULL,
  Cq_range = Cq.range, model = l5
)
# Same as above, but without Cq.range
no_range <- limit_cq(data = test, cyc = 1, fluo = NULL, model = l5)

# Same as above, but only three columns
no_range234 <- limit_cq(data = test, cyc = 1, fluo = c(2:4), model = l5)
