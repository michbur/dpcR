  Abstract                 = {The genetic stability of transgenes is a critical characteristic used to assess constructed cell lines used for vaccine production. The evaluation of gene copy numbers by a {qPCR} method, is one of the most common approaches used to assess the consistency of transgenes in a constructed cell line. The cell line {AV}529-19 is a Vero-based cell line specifically engineered to express the {HSV}-1 {UL}5 and {UL}29 open reading frames. {AV}529-19 is used to support the replication of a defective {HSV}-2 viral candidate vaccine called {HSV}529. To assess the genetic stability of the {UL}5 and {UL}29 transgenes in {AV}529-19 cells, a digital {PCR}-based approach was developed. During characterization of the test method, the specificity, accuracy, and intermediate precision of the assay was investigated based on regulatory guidelines. The developed assay was used to monitor the stability of the transgenes in the manufactured {AV}529-19 cell lines by comparison of transgene copy numbers in the master cell bank ({MCB}) with their copy numbers in the extended cell bank ({ECB}). Results showed that the {UL}29 and {UL}5 transgenes are stable in that there are one and three copies of the {UL}29 and {UL}5 genes, respectively, per cell in both the {AV}529-19 {MCB} and {ECB}.},

We assessed the feasibility of a nanofluidic digital {PCR} array platform to detect and quantify {KRAS} mutations simultaneously in clinically relevant samples.
{METHODS}: We assessed 2 groups of patients (colorectal and pancreatic disease): Group 1 consisted of 27 patients with colorectal carcinomas, 14 patients with adenomas, and 5 control individuals; group 2 consisted of 42 patients with pancreatic carcinoma, 4 with adenocarcinomas of the ampulla, and 6 with chronic pancreatitis). Digital {PCR} was performed with the Digital Array Chip (Fluidigm).
{RESULTS}: Nanofluidic digital {PCR} detected mutant alleles at 0.05\% to 0.1\%, depending on the variant analyzed. For the colorectal disease group, conventional {PCR} detected 9 (64\%) of 14 adenomas that were positive for {KRAS} mutants, whereas digital {PCR} increased this number to 11 (79\%) of 14. Sixteen (59\%) of 27 carcinomas showed {KRAS} mutation with conventional {PCR}. Two additional cases were detected with digital {PCR}. In 5 cases (3 adenomas, 2 carcinomas), the total number of mutant alleles changed. For the pancreatic disease group, digital {PCR} increased the number of positive cases from 26 to 34 (81\%) and identified ? 2 mutant alleles in 25 cases, compared with conventional {PCR}, which identified multiple {KRAS} mutant alleles in only 12 cases. A good correlation was observed between results obtained with tumor biopsies and those obtained with pancreatic juice.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Digital {PCR} provides a robust, quantitative measure of the proportion of {KRAS} mutant alleles in routinely obtained samples. It also allows a better classification of tumors, with potential clinical relevance.},

  Abstract                 = {{BACKGROUND}: Cell-free fetal {DNA} ({cffDNA}) constitutes approximately 10\% of the cell-free {DNA} in maternal plasma and is a suitable source of fetal genetic material for noninvasive prenatal diagnosis ({NIPD}). The objective of this study was to determine the feasibility of using digital {PCR} for {NIPD} in pregnancies at risk of sickle cell anemia.
{METHODS}: Minor-groove binder ({MGB}) {TaqMan} probes were designed to discriminate between wild-type hemoglobin A and mutant (hemoglobin S) alleles encoded by the {HBB} (hemoglobin, beta) gene in {cffDNA} isolated from maternal plasma samples obtained from pregnancies at risk of sickle cell anemia. The fractional fetal {DNA} concentration was assessed in male-bearing pregnancies with a digital {PCR} assay for the Y chromosome-specific marker {DYS}14. In pregnancies with a female fetus, a panel of biallelic insertion/deletion polymorphism (indel) markers was developed for the quantification of the fetal {DNA} fraction. We used digital real-time {PCR} to analyze the dosage of the variant encoding hemoglobin S relative to that encoding wild-type hemoglobin A.
{RESULTS}: The sickle cell genotype was correctly determined in 82\% (37 of 45) of male fetuses and 75\% (15 of 20) of female fetuses. Mutation status was determined correctly in 100\% of the cases (25 samples) with fractional fetal {DNA} concentrations {\textgreater}7\%. The panel of indels was informative in 65\% of the female-bearing pregnancies.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Digital {PCR} can be used to determine the genotype of fetuses at risk for sickle cell anemia. Optimization of the fractional fetal {DNA} concentration is essential. More-informative indel markers are needed for this assay's comprehensive use in cases of a female fetus.},

  Abstract                 = {{OBJECTIVE}: Cell-free fetal {DNA} is a source of fetal genetic material that can be used for non-invasive prenatal diagnosis. Usually constituting less than 10\% of the total cell free {DNA} in maternal plasma, the majority is maternal in origin. Optimizing conditions for maximizing yield of cell-free fetal {DNA} will be crucial for effective implementation of testing. We explore factors influencing yield of fetal {DNA} from maternal blood samples, including assessment of collection tubes containing cell-stabilizing agents, storage temperature, interval to sample processing and {DNA} extraction method used.
{METHODS}: Microfluidic digital {PCR} was performed to precisely quantify male (fetal) {DNA}, total {DNA} and long {DNA} fragments (indicative of maternal cellular {DNA}). Real-time {qPCR} was used to assay for the presence of male {SRY} signal in samples.
{RESULTS}: Total cell-free {DNA} quantity increased significantly with time in samples stored in K(3){EDTA} tubes, but only minimally in cell stabilizing tubes. This increase was solely due to the presence of additional long fragment {DNA}, with no change in quantity of fetal or short {DNA}, resulting in a significant decrease in proportion of cell-free fetal {DNA} over time. Storage at 4 °C did not prevent these changes.
{CONCLUSION}: When samples can be processed within eight hours of blood draw, K(3){EDTA} tubes can be used. Prolonged transfer times in K(3){EDTA} tubes should be avoided as the proportion of fetal {DNA} present decreases significantly; in these situations the use of cell stabilising tubes is preferable. The {DNA} extraction kit used may influence success rate of diagnostic tests.},

  Abstract                 = {Mammary tumors are the most frequent cancers in female dogs exhibiting a variety of histopathological differences. There is lack of knowledge about the genomes of these common dog tumors. Five tumors of three different histological subtypes were evaluated. Massive parallel sequencing ({MPS}) was performed in comparison to the respective somatic genome of each animal. Copy number and structural aberrations were validated using droplet digital {PCR} ({ddPCR}). Using mate-pair sequencing chromosomal aneuploidies were found in two tumors, frequent smaller deletions were found in one, inter-chromosomal fusions in one other, whereas one tumor was almost normal. These aberrations affect several known cancer associated genes such as {cMYC}, and {KIT}. One common deletion of the proximal end of {CFA}27, harboring the tumor suppressor gene {PFDN}5 was detected in four tumors. Using {ddPCR}, this deletion was validated and detected in 50\% of tumors (N?=?20). Breakpoint specific {dPCRs} were established for four tumors and tumor specific cell-free {DNA} ({cfDNA}) was detected in the plasma. In one animal tumor-specific {cfDNA} was found {\textgreater}1 year after surgery, attributable to a lung metastasis. Paired-end sequencing proved that copy-number imbalances of the tumor are reflected by the {cfDNA}. This report on chromosomal instability of canine mammary cancers reveals similarities to human breast cancers as well as special canine alterations. This animal model provides a framework for using {MPS} for screening for individual cancer biomarkers with cost effective confirmation and monitoring using {ddPCR}. The possibility exists that {ddPCR} can be expanded to screening for common cancer related variants.},

  Abstract                 = {{BACKGROUND}: Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ({HER}2) testing is routinely performed by immunohistochemistry ({IHC}) and/or fluorescence in situ hybridization ({FISH}) analyses for all new cases of invasive breast carcinoma. {IHC} is easier to perform, but analysis can be subjective and variable. {FISH} offers better diagnostic accuracy and added confidence, particularly when it is used to supplement weak {IHC} signals, but it is more labor intensive and costly than {IHC}. We examined the performance of droplet digital {PCR} ({ddPCR}) as a more precise and less subjective alternative for quantifying {HER}2 {DNA} amplification.
{METHODS}: Thirty-nine cases of invasive breast carcinoma containing ?30\% tumor were classified as positive or negative for {HER}2 by {IHC}, {FISH}, or both. {DNA} templates for these cases were prepared from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded ({FFPE}) tissues to determine the {HER}2 copy number by {ddPCR}. {ddPCR} involved emulsifying hydrolysis probe-based {PCR} reaction mixtures containing the {ERBB}2 [v-erb-b2 erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2, neuro/glioblastoma derived oncogene homolog (avian); also known as {HER}2] gene and chromosome 17 centromere assays into nanoliter-sized droplets for thermal cycling and analysis.
{RESULTS}: {ddPCR} distinguished, through differences in the level of {HER}2 amplification, the 10 {HER}2-positive samples from the 29 {HER}2-negative samples with 100\% concordance to {HER}2 status obtained by {FISH} and {IHC} analysis. {ddPCR} results agreed with the {FISH} results for the 6 cases that were equivocal by {IHC} analyses, confirming 2 of these samples as positive for {HER}2 and the other 4 as negative.
{CONCLUSIONS}: {ddPCR} can be used as a molecular-analysis tool to precisely measure copy number alterations in {FFPE} samples of heterogeneous breast tumor tissue.},

Random and independent distribution of target {DNA} molecules throughout partitions, which is critical to accurate digital {PCR} measurement, was demonstrated by spatial distribution analysis. The estimated relative uncertainty for target {DNA} concentration was under 6\% when analyzing five digital panels comprising 765 partitions each, provided the panels contained an average of 212 to 3,365 template molecules. Partition volume was a major component of this uncertainty estimate. These findings can be applied to other digital {PCR} studies to improve confidence in such measurements.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent advances in nanofluidic technologies have enabled the use of Integrated Fluidic Circuits ({IFCs}) for high-throughput Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ({SNP}) genotyping ({GT}). In this study, we implemented and validated a relatively low cost nanofluidic system for {SNP}-{GT} with and without Specific Target Amplification ({STA}). As proof of principle, we first validated the effect of input {DNA} copy number on genotype call rate using well characterised, digital {PCR} ({dPCR}) quantified human genomic {DNA} samples and then implemented the validated method to genotype 45 {SNPs} in the humpback whale, Megaptera novaeangliae, nuclear genome. When {STA} was not incorporated, for a homozygous human {DNA} sample, reaction chambers containing, on average 9 to 97 copies, showed 100\% call rate and accuracy. Below 9 copies, the call rate decreased, and at one copy it was 40\%. For a heterozygous human {DNA} sample, the call rate decreased from 100\% to 21\% when predicted copies per reaction chamber decreased from 38 copies to one copy. The tightness of genotype clusters on a scatter plot also decreased. In contrast, when the same samples were subjected to {STA} prior to genotyping a call rate and a call accuracy of 100\% were achieved. Our results demonstrate that low input {DNA} copy number affects the quality of data generated, in particular for a heterozygous sample. Similar to human genomic {DNA}, a call rate and a call accuracy of 100\% was achieved with whale genomic {DNA} samples following multiplex {STA} using either 15 or 45 {SNP}-{GT} assays. These calls were 100\% concordant with their true genotypes determined by an independent method, suggesting that the nanofluidic system is a reliable platform for executing call rates with high accuracy and concordance in genomic sequences derived from biological tissue.},

  Abstract                 = {Multiple displacement amplification ({MDA}) is an isothermal, sequence-independent method for the amplification of high molecular weight {DNA} that is driven by ?29 {DNA} polymerase ({DNAP}). Here we report digital {MDA} ({dMDA}), an ultrasensitive method for quantifying nucleic acid fragments of unknown sequence. We use the new assay to show that our custom ?29 {DNAP} preparation is free of contamination at the limit of detection of the {dMDA} assay (1 contaminating molecule per assay microliter). Contamination in commercially available preparations is also investigated. The results of the {dMDA} assay provide strong evidence that the so-called 'template-independent' {MDA} background can be attributed to high-molecular weight contaminants and is not primer-derived in the commercial kits tested. {dMDA} is orders of magnitude more sensitive than {PCR}-based techniques for detection of microbial genomic {DNA} fragments and opens up new possibilities for the ultrasensitive quantification of {DNA} fragments in a wide variety of application areas using {MDA} chemistry and off-the-shelf hardware developed for digital {PCR}.},

  Abstract                 = {{OBJECTIVE}: The {IDH}1(R132H) mutation is both a strong prognostic predictor and a diagnostic hallmark of gliomas and therefore has major clinical relevance. Here, we developed a new technique to detect the {IDH}1(R132H) mutation in the plasma of patients with glioma.
{METHODS}: Small-size {DNA} (150-250 base pairs) was extracted from the plasma of 31 controls and 80 patients with glioma with known {IDH}1(R132H) status and correlated with {MRI} data. The {IDH}1(R132H) mutation was detected by a combination of coamplification at lower denaturation temperature and digital {PCR}.
{RESULTS}: The small size {DNA} concentration was 1.2 ng/{mL} (range 0.1-6.6) in controls vs 1.2 ng/{mL} (range 0.1-50.3) in patients with glioma (p = not significant) and 0.9 ng/{mL} (0.0-3.0) in low-grade gliomas vs 1.5 ng/{mL} in high-grade gliomas (p {\textless} 0.01). The small size {DNA} concentration correlated with enhancing tumor volume (1.6 ng/{mL} [0.4-24.9] when {\textless}10 cm(3) and 14.0 ng/{mL} [0.6-50.3] when ?10 cm(3)). The {IDH}1(R132H) mutation was detected in 15 out of 25 plasma {DNA} mixtures (60\%) from patients with mutated tumors and in none of the 14 patients with a nonmutated tumor. The sensitivity increased with enhancing tumor volume (3/9 in nonenhancing tumors, 6/10 for enhancing volume {\textless}10 cm(3), and 6/6 for enhancing volume ?10 cm(3)).
{CONCLUSION}: With a specificity of 100\% and a sensitivity related to the tumor volume and contrast enhancement, {IDH}1(R132H) identification has a valuable diagnostic accuracy in patients not amenable to biopsy.},

  Abstract                 = {{PURPOSE}: : To distinguish the cis-trans relationship of two sequence changes and to arrive at an accurate molecular diagnosis for autosomal recessive disorders, methods such as Sanger sequencing cannot differentiate whether sequence changes are in cis or trans. In addition, most techniques theoretically appropriate for allelic discrimination depend on the specific identified sequence changes for assay design, need extensive optimization, or may not be suitable. We developed a method that does not fully depend on the specific nucleotide changes. It enables efficient assay design and practical implementation of allelic discrimination.
{METHODS}: : Digital polymerase chain reaction ({PCR}) was used to separate and amplify alleles. Sanger sequencing was subsequently used to identify sequence changes.
{RESULTS}: : We developed a cost-effective digital {PCR} method for allelic discrimination of short amplicons and demonstrated it with p.Val27Ile and p.Glu114Gly in {GJB}2 as an example. We also successfully developed a long-range digital {PCR} approach to determine the cis-trans relationship of p.Arg117His and 5T in the {CFTR} gene.
{CONCLUSION}: : Digital {PCR} for allelic discrimination can be clinically implemented to determine the allelic configuration of relatively common sequence changes which frequently appear together and have clinical ramifications, such as the combination of p.Val27Ile and p.Glu114Gly in the {GJB}2 gene and p.Arg117His and 5T in {CFTR}.},

  Abstract                 = {Development of biofluid-based molecular diagnostic tests for cancer is an important step towards tumor characterization and real-time monitoring in a minimally invasive fashion. Extracellular vesicles ({EVs}) are released from tumor cells into body fluids and can provide a powerful platform for tumor biomarkers because they carry tumor proteins and nucleic acids. Detecting rare point mutations in the background of wild-type sequences in biofluids such as blood and cerebrospinal fluid ({CSF}) remains a major challenge. Techniques such as {BEAMing} (beads, emulsion, amplification, magnetics) {PCR} and droplet digital {PCR} ({ddPCR}) are substantially more sensitive than many other assays for mutant sequence detection. Here, we describe a novel approach that combines biofluid {EV} {RNA} and {BEAMing} {RT}-{PCR} ({EV}-{BEAMing}), as well droplet digital {PCR} to interrogate mutations from glioma tumors. {EVs} from {CSF} of patients with glioma were shown to contain mutant {IDH}1 transcripts, and we were able to reliably detect and quantify mutant and wild-type {IDH}1 {RNA} transcripts in {CSF} of patients with gliomas. {EV}-{BEAMing} and {EV}-{ddPCR} represent a valuable new strategy for cancer diagnostics, which can be applied to a variety of biofluids and neoplasms.Molecular Therapy-Nucleic Acids (2013) 2, e109; doi:10.1038/mtna.2013.28; published online 23 July 2013.},

The analytical power of these methods, namely sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and precision, should catalyse the eventual clinical use of non-invasive prenatal diagnosis.},

  Abstract                 = {Brain metastases are associated with high morbidity as well as with poor prognosis and survival in breast cancer patients. Despite its clinical importance, metastasis of breast cancer cells through the blood-brain barrier ({BBB}) is poorly understood. The objective of our study was to investigate whether cancer-associated fibroblasts ({CAFs}) play crucial roles in breast cancer brain metastasis. Using a cell adhesion assays, in vitro {BBB} permeability and transmigration assays, and soft agar colony formation assays, we investigated the physical roles of {CAFs} in breast cancer brain metastasis. We also performed immunofluorescence, flow cytometric analysis, Droplet Digital {PCR}, and Simon({TM}) Simple Western System to confirm changes in expression levels. We established two novel three-dimensional (3-D) culture systems using a perpendicular slide chamber and applying 3-D embedded culture method to reflect brain metastasis conditions. With a newly developed device, {CAFs} was proven to promote cell adhesion to human brain microvascular endothelial cells, in vitro {BBB} permeability and transmigration, and colony formation of breast cancer cells. Furthermore, {CAFs} enhanced the invasive migration of breast cancer cells in two kinds of 3-D cultures. These 3-D models also reliably recapitulate the initial steps of {BBB} transmigration, micro-metastasis, and colonization. Expression of integrin ?5?1 and ?v?3, c-{MET}, and ?2,6-siayltransferase was increased in breast cancer cells that migrated through the {BBB}. In conclusion, based on our in vitro {BBB} and co-culture models, our data suggest that {CAFs} may play a role in breast cancer brain metastasis. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  Abstract                 = {{MOTIVATION}: A growing body of literature has demonstrated the potential for non-invasive diagnosis of a variety of human genetic diseases using cell-free {DNA} extracted from maternal plasma samples in early gestation. Such methods are of great significance to the obstetrics community because of their potential use as clinical standard of care. Proof of concept for such approaches has been established for aneuploidy and paternally inherited dominant traits. Although significant progress has recently been made, the non-invasive diagnosis of monogenic diseases that segregate in a recessive mendelian fashion is more problematic. Recent developments in microfluidic digital {PCR} and {DNA} sequencing have resulted in a number of recent advances in this field. These have largely, although not exclusively, been used for the development of diagnostic methods for aneuploidy. However, given their prevalence, it is likely that such methods will be utilized towards the development of non-invasive methods for diagnosing monogenetic disorders.
{RESULTS}: With this in mind, we have undertaken a statistical modeling of three contemporary (digital) analytical methods in the context of prenatal diagnosis using cell free {DNA} for monogenic diseases that segregate in a recessive mendelian fashion. We provide an experimental framework for the future development of diagnostic methods in this context that should be considered when designing molecular assays that seek to establish proof of concept in this field.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper describes a very simple and robust microfluidic device for digitizing samples into an array of discrete volumes. The device is based on an inherent fluidic phenomenon, where an incoming aqueous sample divides itself into an array of chambers that have been primed with an immiscible phase. Self-digitization of sample volumes results from the interplay between fluidic forces, interfacial tension, channel geometry, and the final stability of the digitized samples in the chambers. Here, we describe experiments and simulations that were used to characterize these parameters and the conditions under which the self-digitization process occurred. Unlike existing methods used to partition samples into an array, our method is able to digitize 100\% of a sample into a localized array without any loss of sample volume. The final volume of the discretized sample at each location is defined by the geometry and size of each chamber. Thus, we can form an array of samples with varying but predefined volumes. We exploited this feature to separate the crystal growth of otherwise concomitant polymorphs from a single solution. Additionally, we demonstrated the removal of the digitized samples from the chambers for downstream analysis, as well as the addition of reagents to the digitized samples. We believe this simple method will be useful in a broad range of applications where a large array of discretized samples is required, including digital {PCR}, single-cell analysis, and cell-based drug screening.},

  Abstract                 = {Quantitative analysis of genetically modified ({GM}) foods requires estimation of the amount of the transgenic event relative to an endogenous gene. Regulatory authorities in the European Union ({EU}) have defined the labelling threshold for {GM} food on the copy number ratio between the transgenic event and an endogenous gene. Real-time polymerase chain reaction ({PCR}) is currently being used for quantification of {GM} organisms ({GMOs}). Limitations in real-time {PCR} applications to detect very low number of {DNA} targets has led to new developments such as the digital {PCR} ({dPCR}) which allows accurate measurement of {DNA} copies without the need for a reference calibrator. In this paper, the amount of maize {MON}810 and hmg copies present in a {DNA} extract from seed powders certified for their mass content and for their copy number ratio was measured by {dPCR}. The ratio of these absolute copy numbers determined by {dPCR} was found to be identical to the ratios measured by real-time quantitative {PCR} ({qPCR}) using a plasmid {DNA} calibrator. These results indicate that both methods could be applied to determine the copy number ratio in {MON}810. The reported values were in agreement with estimations from a model elaborated to convert mass fractions into copy number fractions in {MON}810 varieties. This model was challenged on two {MON}810 varieties used for the production of {MON}810 certified reference materials ({CRMs}) which differ in the parental origin of the introduced {GM} trait. We conclude that {dPCR} has a high metrological quality and can be used for certifying {GM} {CRMs} in terms of {DNA} copy number ratio.},

One of the critical factors in the measurement of copy number concentrations by digital PCR is the partition volume. Therefore, we determined the average droplet volume by optical microscopy, revealing an average droplet volume that is 8e\% smaller than the droplet volume used as the defined parameter in the QuantaSoft software version 1.3.2.0 (Bio-Rad) to calculate the copy number concentration. This observation explains why copy number concentrations estimated with ddPCR and using an average droplet volume predefined in the QuantaSoft software were systematically lower than those measured by dPCR, creating a significant bias between the values obtained by these two techniques. The difference was not significant anymore when the measured droplet volume of 0.834enL was used to estimate copy number concentrations. A new version of QuantaSoft software (version 1.6.6.0320), which has since been released with Bio-Rades new QX200 systems and QX100 upgrades, uses a droplet volume of 0.85enL as a defined parameter to calculate copy number concentration.,

  Abstract                 = {High-throughput {qPCR} approaches enable profiling of multiple genes in single cells, bringing new insights to complex biological processes and offering opportunities for single cell-based monitoring of cancer cells and stem cell-based therapies. However workflows with well-defined sources of variation are required for clinical diagnostics and testing of tissue engineered products. In a study of neural stem cell lines, we investigated the performance of lysis, reverse transcription ({RT}), pre-amplification ({PA}) and nanofluidic {qPCR} steps at the single cell level in terms of efficiency, precision and limit of detection. We compared protocols using a separate lysis buffer with cell capture directly in {RT}-{PA} reagent. The two methods were found to have similar lysis efficiencies whilst the direct {RT}-{PA} approach showed improved precision. Digital {PCR} was used to relate pre-amplified template copy numbers to Cq values and revealed where low quality signals may impact upon the analysis. We investigated the impact of calibration and data normalisation strategies as a means of minimising the impact of inter-experimental variation on gene expression values and found that both approaches can improve data comparability. This study provides validation and guidance for the application of high-throughput {qPCR} workflows for gene expression profiling of single cells.},

  Abstract                 = {{BACKGROUND}: Assessment of {DNA} integrity and quantity remains a bottleneck for high-throughput molecular genotyping technologies, including next-generation sequencing. In particular, {DNA} extracted from paraffin-embedded tissues, a major potential source of tumor {DNA}, varies widely in quality, leading to unpredictable sequencing data. We describe a picoliter droplet-based digital {PCR} method that enables simultaneous detection of {DNA} integrity and the quantity of amplifiable {DNA}.
{METHODS}: Using a multiplex assay, we detected 4 different target lengths (78, 159, 197, and 550 bp). Assays were validated with human genomic {DNA} fragmented to sizes of 170 bp to 3000 bp. The technique was validated with {DNA} quantities as low as 1 ng. We evaluated 12 {DNA} samples extracted from paraffin-embedded lung adenocarcinoma tissues.
{RESULTS}: One sample contained no amplifiable {DNA}. The fractions of amplifiable {DNA} for the 11 other samples were between 0.05\% and 10.1\% for 78-bp fragments and ?1\% for longer fragments. Four samples were chosen for enrichment and next-generation sequencing. The quality of the sequencing data was in agreement with the results of the {DNA}-integrity test. Specifically, {DNA} with low integrity yielded sequencing results with lower levels of coverage and uniformity and had higher levels of false-positive variants.
{CONCLUSIONS}: The development of {DNA}-quality assays will enable researchers to downselect samples or process more {DNA} to achieve reliable genome sequencing with the highest possible efficiency of cost and effort, as well as minimize the waste of precious samples.},

  Abstract                 = {Presence of genetically modified organisms (GMO) in food and feed products is regulated in many countries. The European Union (EU) has implemented a threshold for labeling of products containing more than 0.9\% of authorized GMOs per ingredient. As the number of GMOs has increased over time, standard-curve based simplex quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analyses are no longer sufficiently cost-effective, despite widespread use of initial PCR based screenings. Newly developed GMO detection methods, also multiplex methods, are mostly focused on screening and detection but not quantification. On the basis of droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) technology, multiplex assays for quantification of all 12 EU authorized GM maize lines (per April first 2015) were developed. Because of high sequence similarity of some of the 12 GM targets, two separate multiplex assays were needed. In both assays (4-plex and 10-plex), the transgenes were labeled with one fluorescence reporter and the endogene with another (GMO concentration = transgene/endogene ratio). It was shown that both multiplex assays produce specific results and that performance parameters such as limit of quantification, repeatability, and trueness comply with international recommendations for GMO quantification methods. Moreover, for samples containing GMOs, the throughput and cost-effectiveness is significantly improved compared to qPCR. Thus, it was concluded that the multiplex ddPCR assays could be applied for routine quantification of 12 EU authorized GM maize lines. In case of new authorizations, the events can easily be added to the existing multiplex assays. The presented principle of quantitative multiplexing can be applied to any other domain.},

Quantification of {amoA} genes in ammonia oxidizing bacteria ({AOB}) and archaea ({AOA}), and of {nirS} and {nosZ} genes in the denitrifiers is very important for determining their distribution and abundance in the natural environment. A plasmid reference material containing {nirS}, {nosZ}, {amoA}-{AOB}, and {amoA}-{AOA} is developed to provide a {DNA} standard with copy number concentration for ensuring comparability and reliability of quantification of these genes. Droplet digital {PCR} ({ddPCR}) was evaluated for characterization of the plasmid reference material. The result revealed that restriction endonuclease digestion of plasmids can improve amplification efficiency and minimize the measurement bias of {ddPCR}. Compared with the conformation of the plasmid, the size of the {DNA} fragment containing the target sequence and the location of the restriction site relative to the target sequence are not significant factors affecting plasmid quantification by {ddPCR}. Liquid chromatography-isotope dilution mass spectrometry ({LC}-{IDMS}) was used to provide independent data for quantifying the plasmid reference material. The copy number concentration of the digested plasmid determined by {ddPCR} agreed well with that determined by {LC}-{IDMS}, improving both the accuracy and reliability of the plasmid reference material. The reference value, with its expanded uncertainty (k?=?2), of the plasmid reference material was determined to be (5.19?±?0.41)?×?10(9) copies ?L(-1) by averaging the results of two independent measurements.

Digital {PCR} ({dPCR}) was employed to quantify the same lambda {DNA} solution to provide independent data for comparing the performance of two quantitative methods. On the basis of the {LC}-{IDMS} measurement after ultrasonic treatment of the sample, the concentration of lambda {DNA} was 273.1 ± 9.8 ?g/g (expanded uncertainty at the 95\% confidence interval). This shows good agreement with the data from {dPCR}. Additionally, the result calculated on the basis of the sum of the concentrations of the four {dNMPs} is the same as that calculated on the basis of the sequence, which indicates that knowledge of the {DNA} sequence and length is unnecessary to measure the total {DNA} concentration when applying ultrasonic treatment-{LC}-{IDMS}.},

  Abstract                 = {Here we report on the first assessment of droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) for detection and absolute quantification of two quarantine plant pathogenic bacteria that infect many species of the Rosaceae and Solanaceae families: Erwinia amylovora and Ralstonia solanacearum. An open-source R script was written for the ddPCR data analysis. Analysis of a set of samples with known health status aided the assessment and selection of different threshold settings (QuantaSoft analysis, definetherain pipeline and manual threshold), which led to optimal diagnostic specificity. The interpretation of the E. amylovora ddPCR was straightforward, and the analysis approach had little influence on the final results and the concentrations determined. The sensitivity and linear range were similar to those for real-time PCR (qPCR), for the analysis of both bacterial suspensions and plant material, making ddPCR a viable choice when both detection and quantification are desired. With the R. solanacearum ddPCR, the use of a high global threshold was necessary to exclude false-positive reactions that are sometimes observed in healthy plant material. ddPCR significantly improved the analytical sensitivity over that of qPCR, and improved the detection of low concentrations of R. solanacearum in potato tuber samples. Accurate and rapid absolute quantification of both of these bacteria in pure culture was achieved by direct ddPCR. Our data confirm the suitability of these ddPCR assays for routine detection and quantification of plant pathogens and for preparation of defined in-house reference materials with known target concentrations.},

{METHODS}: Through power equations, we modeled the number of wells necessary to determine the feasibility of digital {PCR} as a practical method for trisomy 21 risk assessment.
{RESULTS}: The number of wells needed is a direct correlate of the ability to isolate free fetal {DNA}. If a 20\% fetal {DNA} enhancement can be achieved, then 2,609 counts would be sufficient to achieve a 99\% detection rate for a 1\% false-positive rate and potentially feasible with readily available plates. However, if only a 2\% increase is seen, then 220,816 counts will be necessary, and over 110,000 would be needed just to achieve 95\% for a 5\% false-positive rate - both far beyond current commercially available technology.
{CONCLUSION}: There are several noninvasive prenatal diagnostic methods which may reach commercialization; all have differing potential advantages and disadvantages. Digital {PCR} is potentially a cheaper methodology for trisomy 21, but it is too early to determine the optimal method.},

  Abstract                 = {Comprehensive profiling of nucleic acids in genetically heterogeneous samples is important for clinical and basic research applications. Universal digital high-resolution melt (U-{dHRM}) is a new approach to broad-based {PCR} diagnostics and profiling technologies that can overcome issues of poor sensitivity due to contaminating nucleic acids and poor specificity due to primer or probe hybridization inaccuracies for single nucleotide variations. The U-{dHRM} approach uses broad-based primers or ligated adapter sequences to universally amplify all nucleic acid molecules in a heterogeneous sample, which have been partitioned, as in digital {PCR}. Extensive assay optimization enables direct sequence identification by algorithm-based matching of melt curve shape and Tm to a database of known sequence-specific melt curves. We show that single-molecule detection and single nucleotide sensitivity is possible. The feasibility and utility of U-{dHRM} is demonstrated through detection of bacteria associated with polymicrobial blood infection and {microRNAs} ({miRNAs}) associated with host response to infection. U-{dHRM} using broad-based 16S {rRNA} gene primers demonstrates universal single cell detection of bacterial pathogens, even in the presence of larger amounts of contaminating bacteria; U-{dHRM} using universally adapted Lethal-7 {miRNAs} in a heterogeneous mixture showcases the single copy sensitivity and single nucleotide specificity of this approach.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a new approach for the sensitive detection and accurate quantitation of messenger ribonucleic acid ({mRNA}) gene transcripts in single cells. First, the entire population of {mRNAs} is encoded with molecular barcodes during reverse transcription. After amplification of the gene targets of interest, molecular barcodes are counted by sequencing or scored on a simple hybridization detector to reveal the number of molecules in the starting sample. Since absolute quantities are measured, calibration to standards is unnecessary, and many of the relative quantitation challenges such as polymerase chain reaction ({PCR}) bias are avoided. We apply the method to gene expression analysis of minute sample quantities and demonstrate precise measurements with sensitivity down to sub single-cell levels. The method is an easy, single-tube, end point assay utilizing standard thermal cyclers and {PCR} reagents. Accurate and precise measurements are obtained without any need for cycle-to-cycle intensity-based real-time monitoring or physical partitioning into multiple reactions (e.g., digital {PCR}). Further, since all {mRNA} molecules are encoded with molecular barcodes, amplification can be used to generate more material for multiple measurements and technical replicates can be carried out on limited samples. The method is particularly useful for small sample quantities, such as single-cell experiments. Digital encoding of cellular content preserves true abundance levels and overcomes distortions introduced by amplification.},

However, methods that are available to quantify low-level chimerism lack accuracy. Therefore, we developed and validated a method for quantifying chimerism based on digital {PCR} technology. We demonstrate accurate quantification that far exceeds what is possible with analog {qPCR} down to 0.01\% with the potential to go even lower. Also, this method is inherently more informative than {qPCR}. We expect the advantages of digital {PCR} will make it the preferred method for chimerism analysis.},

  Abstract                 = {{PURPOSE}: Digital {PCR} is a highly accurate method of determining {DNA} concentration. We adapted digital {PCR} to determine the presence of oncogenic amplification through noninvasive analysis of circulating free plasma {DNA} and exemplify this approach by developing a plasma {DNA} digital {PCR} assay for {HER}2 copy number.
{EXPERIMENTAL} {DESIGN}: The reference gene for copy number assessment was assessed experimentally and bioinformatically. Chromosome 17 pericentromeric probes were shown to be suboptimal, and {EFTUD}2 at chromosome position 17q21.31 was selected for analysis. Digital {PCR} assay parameters were determined on plasma samples from a development cohort of 65 patients and assessed in an independent validation cohort of plasma samples from 58 patients with metastatic breast cancer. The sequential probability ratio test was used to assign the plasma {DNA} digital {PCR} test as being {HER}2-positive or -negative in the validation cohort.
{RESULTS}: In the development cohort, the {HER}2:{EFTUD}2 plasma {DNA} copy number ratio had a receiver operator area under the curve ({AUC}) = 0.92 [95\% confidence interval ({CI}), 0.86-0.99, P = 0.0003]. In the independent validation cohort, 64\% (7 of 11) of patients with {HER}2-amplified cancers were classified as plasma digital {PCR} {HER}2-positive and 94\% (44 of 47) of patients with {HER}2-nonamplified cancers were classified as digital {PCR} {HER}2-negative, with a positive and negative predictive value of 70\% and 92\%, respectively.
{CONCLUSION}: Analysis of plasma {DNA} with digital {PCR} has the potential to screen for the acquisition of {HER}2 amplification in metastatic breast cancer. This approach could potentially be adapted to the analysis of any locus amplified in cancer.},

To demonstrate the feasibility of more sensitive approaches, 62 samples from 43 patients with {CML} were screened by conventional {RQ}-{PCR}, replicate {RQ}-{PCR} ({rRQ}-{PCR}), and/or nanofluidic digital {PCR} ({dPCR}). First, we confirmed the correlation of {dPCR} to conventional {RQ}-{PCR} using 30 patient samples with various minimal residual disease ({MRD}) levels. When the sensitivity limits were determined using cell line and patient sample dilutions, {rRQ}-{PCR} and {dPCR} with pre-amplification showed 2-3 log improvement compared to conventional {RQ}-{PCR}, and 24 of 32 {PCR} negative samples as assayed by conventional {RQ}-{PCR} showed detectable {BCR}-{ABL} in {rRQ}-{PCR} and/or {dPCR}. More important, using {dPCR} in conjunction with a pre-amplification step, a continuous decline in {MRD} level could be precisely monitored even after it became undetectable by conventional {RQ}-{PCR}. In this study, both {rRQ}-{PCR} and {dPCR} demonstrated successful detection of {BCR}-{ABL} transcripts not detectable in conventional {RQ}-{PCR}, and these data show the potential feasibility of highly sensitive {PCR} approaches for molecular monitoring and clinical relevance in future {CML} management by allowing further characterization of patients who achieve {PCR} negativity in a conventional {RQ}-{PCR} assay.},

The performance of each {qPCR} assay was compared in head-to-head experiments investigating limits of detection, analytical precision, predicted hybridization to 16S {rRNA} gene sequences from a reference database, and relative marker concentrations in fecal and sewage samples. The modified {HF}183/{BacR}287 assay is equal to or improves upon the original {HF}183/{BFDrev} assay. In addition, a {qPCR} chemistry designed to combat amplification inhibition and a multiplexed internal amplification control are included as safeguards against amplification inhibition.

However, it remains to be determined how suitable these approaches are for the detection of more subtle fetal genetic alterations, such as those involved in hereditary Mendelian disorders (e.g., thalassemia and cystic fibrosis). New technical developments, such as microfluidics and reliable automated scanning microscopes, have indicated that it may be possible to efficiently retrieve and examine circulating fetal cells.

By controlling chamber height to droplet diameter ratios we predictively control three-dimensional packing configurations with varying degrees of droplet overlap to increase droplet density and imaging sensor area coverage efficiency. Fluorescence imaging of the densely packed 3D reactor arrays, up to three layers high, demonstrates high throughput quantitative analysis of single-molecule reactions. Now a greater number of microreactors can be observed and studied in a single picture frame without the need for confocal imaging, slide scanners, or complicated image processing techniques. Compared to 2D designs, tunable 3D reactor arrays yield up to a threefold increase in density and use 100\% of the sensor's imaging area to enable simultaneous imaging a larger number of reactions without sacrificing digital quantification performance.

  Abstract                 = {Digital droplet reactors are useful as chemical and biological containers to discretize reagents into picolitre or nanolitre volumes for analysis of single cells, organisms, or molecules. However, most {DNA} based assays require processing of samples on the order of tens of microlitres and contain as few as one to as many as millions of fragments to be detected. Presented in this work is a droplet microfluidic platform and fluorescence imaging setup designed to better meet the needs of the high-throughput and high-dynamic-range by integrating multiple high-throughput droplet processing schemes on the chip. The design is capable of generating over 1-million, monodisperse, 50 picolitre droplets in 2-7 minutes that then self-assemble into high density 3-dimensional sphere packing configurations in a large viewing chamber for visualization and analysis. This device then undergoes on-chip polymerase chain reaction ({PCR}) amplification and fluorescence detection to digitally quantify the sample's nucleic acid contents. Wide-field fluorescence images are captured using a low cost 21-megapixel digital camera and macro-lens with an 8-12 cm(2) field-of-view at 1× to 0.85× magnification, respectively. We demonstrate both end-point and real-time imaging ability to perform on-chip quantitative digital {PCR} analysis of the entire droplet array.

  Abstract                 = {Quantitative real-time {PCR} ({QRT}-{PCR}) has been widely implemented for clinical viral load testing, but a lack of standardization and relatively poor precision have hindered its usefulness. Digital {PCR} offers highly precise, direct quantification without requiring a calibration curve. Performance characteristics of real-time {PCR} were compared to those of droplet digital {PCR} ({ddPCR}) for cytomegalovirus ({CMV}) load testing. Tenfold serial dilutions of the World Health Organization ({WHO}) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology ({NIST}) {CMV} quantitative standards were tested, together with the {AcroMetrix} {CMV} tc panel (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, {CA}) and 50 human plasma specimens. Each method was evaluated using all three standards for quantitative linearity, lower limit of detection ({LOD}), and accuracy. Quantitative correlation, mean viral load, and variability were compared. Real-time {PCR} showed somewhat higher sensitivity than {ddPCR} ({LODs}, 3 log(10) versus 4 log(10) copies/ml and {IU}/ml for {NIST} and {WHO} standards, respectively). Both methods showed a high degree of linearity and quantitative correlation for standards (R(2) ? 0.98 in each of 6 regression models) and clinical samples (R(2) = 0.93) across their detectable ranges. For higher concentrations, {ddPCR} showed less variability than {QRT}-{PCR} for the {WHO} standards and {AcroMetrix} standards (P {\textless} 0.05). {QRT}-{PCR} showed less variability and greater sensitivity than did {ddPCR} in clinical samples. Both digital and real-time {PCR} provide accurate {CMV} load data over a wide linear dynamic range. Digital {PCR} may provide an opportunity to reduce the quantitative variability currently seen using real-time {PCR}, but methods need to be further optimized to match the sensitivity of real-time {PCR}.},

Standardization is vital, because of interlaboratory variability (due in part to the variety of assays and calibrants). Toward that end, the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology produced a Standard Reference Material 2366 appropriate for establishing metrological traceability of assay calibrants. This standard is composed of {CMV} {DNA} (Towne(Δ147) bacterial artificial chromosome {DNA}). Regions of the {CMV} {DNA} that are commonly used as targets for {PCR} assays were sequenced. Digital {PCR} was used to quantify the {DNA}, with concentration expressed as copies per microliter. The materials were tested for homogeneity and stability. An interlaboratory study was conducted by Quality Control for Molecular Diagnostics (Glasgow, {UK}), in which one component of {SRM} 2366 was included for analysis by participants in a {CMV} external quality assessment and proficiency testing program.},

  Abstract                 = {Droplet digital {PCR} ({ddPCR}) is an emerging nucleic acid detection method that provides absolute quantitations of target sequences without relying on the use of standard curves. The ability of {ddPCR} to detect and quantitate total {HIV}-1 {DNA} and 2-{LTR} circles from a panel of patients on and off antiviral therapy was evaluated compared to established real-time ({RT})-{PCR} methods. To calculate the dynamic range of {ddPCR} for {HIV}-1 {DNA} and 2-{LTR} circles, serial dilutions of {DNA} amplicons or episomes were determined by {ddPCR} as well as with {RT}-{PCR}. {HIV}-1 {DNA} from 3 viremic patients and 4 patients on suppressive antiretroviral therapy, and 2-{LTR} circles from 3 patients with low-level viremia were also quantitated. Copy numbers determined by {ddPCR} of serial dilutions of {HIV}-1 or human {CCR}5 {DNA} amplicon standards were comparable to nominal input copy number. The sensitivity of {ddPCR} to detect {HIV}-1 or {CCR}5 {DNA} was similar to that of {RT}-{PCR}. Low levels of 2-{LTR} circles were detected in samples from all 3 patients by both {ddPCR} and {RT}-{PCR}. {ddPCR} is a promising novel technology for the study of {HIV}-1 reservoirs and persistence, but further optimization of this novel technology would enhance the detection of very low-level viral genetic targets.},

  Abstract                 = {The human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ({HER}2, also known as {erbB}2) gene is involved in signal transduction for cell growth and differentiation. It is a cell surface receptor tyrosine kinase and a proto-oncogene. Overexpression of {HER}2 is of clinical relevance in breast cancer due to its prognostic value correlating elevated expression with worsening clinical outcome. At the same time, {HER}2 assessment is also of importance because successful anti-tumor treatment with Herceptin® is strongly correlated with {HER}2 overexpression in the tumor (approximately 30\% of all breast tumors overexpress {HER}2). In a comprehensive national study, Wolff et al. [1] state that "Approximately 20\% of current {HER}2 testing may be inaccurate" which underscores the importance of developing more accurate methods to determine {HER}2 status. Droplet Digital? {PCR} ({ddPCR}?) has the potential to improve upon {HER}2 measurements due to its ability to quantitate {DNA} and {RNA} targets with high precision and accuracy. Here we present a study which investigates whether {ddPCR} can be used to assess {HER}2 transcript levels in formalin-fixed paraffin embedded ({FFPE}) human breast tumors and whether these {ddPCR} measurements agree with prior assessments of these same samples by pathologists using immunohistochemistry ({IHC}) and in some cases fluorescence in situ hybridization ({FISH}). We also determined the copy number of {HER}2 in these samples as compared to the {CEP}17 reference gene. Results: Clinical {FFPE} samples were successfully studied using {ddPCR} and compared to results from standard {FISH} and {IHC} methodology. The results demonstrate that {ddPCR} can rank order the samples in complete agreement with the current standard methods and that {ddPCR} has the added benefit of providing quantitative results, rather than relying on the expert skill of a seasoned pathologist for determination.},

Three applications demonstrate that the massive partitioning afforded by our {ddPCR} system provides orders of magnitude more precision and sensitivity than real-time {PCR}.

In this study, two extraction methods using similar chemistries but different workflows were compared for isolation efficiency and percent fetal {DNA} recovery. The Akonni Biosystems {TruTip} technology uses a binding matrix embedded in a pipette tip; the Circulating Nucleic Acids Kit from Qiagen employs a spin column approach. The {TruTip} method adds an extra step to decrease the recovery of {DNA} fragments larger than 600 bp from the sample to yield an overall higher percentage of smaller molecular weight {DNA}, effectively enriching for fetal {DNA}. In this evaluation, three separate extraction comparison studies were performed--a dilution series of fragmented {DNA} in plasma, a set of clinical maternal samples, and a blood collection tube time point study of maternal samples. Both extraction methods were found to efficiently extract small fragment {DNA} from large volumes of plasma. In the amended samples, the {TruTip} extraction method was {\textasciitilde}15\% less efficient with overall {DNA} recovery, but yielded an 87\% increase in \% fetal {DNA} relative to the Qiagen method. The average percent increase of fetal {DNA} of {TruTip} extracted samples compared to the Qiagen method was 55\% for all sets of blinded clinical samples. A study comparing extraction efficiencies from whole blood samples incubated up to 48 hours prior to processing into plasma resulted in more consistent \% fetal {DNA} recoveries using {TruTip}. The extracted products were tested on two detection platforms, quantitative real-time {PCR} and droplet digital {PCR}, and yielded similar results for both extraction methods.},

However, {PCR}-inhibitory substances often reduce the efficiency of {PCR}, leading to the underestimation of target gene copy numbers. Digital {PCR} using microfluidics is a new approach that allows absolute quantification of {DNA} molecules. In this study, digital {PCR} was applied to environmental samples, and the effect of {PCR} inhibitors on {DNA} quantification was tested. In the control experiment using ? {DNA} and humic acids, underestimation of ? {DNA} at 1/4400 of the theoretical value was observed with 6.58 ng ?L(-1) humic acids. In contrast, digital {PCR} provided accurate quantification data with a concentration of humic acids up to 9.34 ng ?L(-1). The inhibitory effect of paddy field soil extract on quantification of the archaeal 16S {rRNA} gene was also tested. By diluting the {DNA} extract, quantified copy numbers from real-time {PCR} and digital {PCR} became similar, indicating that dilution was a useful way to remedy {PCR} inhibition. The dilution strategy was, however, not applicable to all natural environmental samples. For example, when marine subsurface sediment samples were tested the copy number of archaeal 16S {rRNA} genes was 1.04×10(3) copies/g-sediment by digital {PCR}, whereas real-time {PCR} only resulted in 4.64×10(2) copies/g-sediment, which was most likely due to an inhibitory effect. The data from this study demonstrated that inhibitory substances had little effect on {DNA} quantification using microfluidics and digital {PCR}, and showed the great advantages of digital {PCR} in accurate quantifications of {DNA} extracted from various microbial habitats.},

Thus far, {EGFR} mutation analysis has not been systematically demonstrated for sputum samples. The aim of the present study was to determine whether {EGFR} mutation analysis is attainable on sputum samples, employing different assays in a multicenter study.
{MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS}: Sputum {DNA} from 10 lung cancer patients with confirmed {EGFR} mutation in their tumour tissue, 10 lung cancer patients without evidence of an {EGFR} mutation, and 10 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ({COPD}) was used for mutation analysis by Cycleave {PCR}, {COLD}-{PCR}, {PangaeaBiotech} {SL} Technology ({PST}), and High Resolution Melting, respectively. Targeted resequencing ({TruSeq} Amplicon Cancer Panel) and droplet digital {PCR} were additionally performed on the 10 samples with {EGFR} mutation.
{RESULTS}: Dependent on the assay, {EGFR} mutations could be detected in 30-50\% of the sputum samples of patients with {EGFR} mutations. The different techniques revealed consistent results, with slightly higher sensitivity for {PST}. Neither the lung cancer patients without {EGFR} mutation nor the {COPD} controls tested positive for {EGFR} mutations in their sputum samples, indicating high clinical specificity of all assays.
{CONCLUSION}: {EGFR} mutations can be detected in sputum samples from patients with {EGFR}-mutated non-small cell lung cancer, which may replace biopsy procedure for some patients.},

  Abstract                 = {Background: Digital PCR (dPCR) is an increasingly popular manifestation of PCR that offers a number of unique advantages when applied to preclinical research, particularly when used to detect rare mutations and in the precise quantification of nucleic acids. As is common with many new research methods, the application of dPCR to potential clinical scenarios is also being increasingly described.
Content: This review addresses some of the factors that need to be considered in the application of dPCR. Compared to real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR), dPCR clearly has the potential to offer more sensitive and considerably more reproducible clinical methods that could lend themselves to diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive tests. But for this to be realized the technology will need to be further developed to reduce cost and simplify application. Concomitantly the preclinical research will need be reported with a comprehensive understanding of the associated errors. dPCR benefits from a far more predictable variance than qPCR but is as susceptible to upstream errors associated with factors like sampling and extraction. dPCR can also suffer systematic bias, particularly leading to underestimation, and internal positive controls are likely to be as important for dPCR as they are for qPCR, especially when reporting the absence of a sequence.
Summary: In this review we highlight some of the considerations that may be needed when applying dPCR and discuss sources of error. The factors discussed here aim to assist in the translation of dPCR to diagnostic, predictive, or prognostic applications.},

  Abstract                 = {There is growing interest in digital {PCR} ({dPCR}) because technological progress makes it a practical and increasingly affordable technology. {dPCR} allows the precise quantification of nucleic acids, facilitating the measurement of small percentage differences and quantification of rare variants. {dPCR} may also be more reproducible and less susceptible to inhibition than quantitative real-time {PCR} ({qPCR}). Consequently, {dPCR} has the potential to have a substantial impact on research as well as diagnostic applications. However, as with {qPCR}, the ability to perform robust meaningful experiments requires careful design and adequate controls. To assist independent evaluation of experimental data, comprehensive disclosure of all relevant experimental details is required. To facilitate this process we present the Minimum Information for Publication of Quantitative Digital {PCR} Experiments guidelines. This report addresses known requirements for {dPCR} that have already been identified during this early stage of its development and commercial implementation. Adoption of these guidelines by the scientific community will help to standardize experimental protocols, maximize efficient utilization of resources, and enhance the impact of this promising new technology.},

We argue that, with some exceptions, anything less than the release of source programs is intolerable for results that depend on computation. The vagaries of hardware, software and natural language will always ensure that exact reproducibility remains uncertain, but withholding code increases the chances that efforts to reproduce results will fail.},

We report here a droplet digital {PCR} ({ddPCR}) assay, which is a next-generation emulsion-based endpoint {PCR} assay for high-precision {MRSA} analysis. Reference cultures of {MRSA}, methicillin-susceptible S. aureus ({MSSA}), and confounders were included as controls. Copan swabs were used to sample cultures and collect specimens for analysis from patients at a large teaching hospital. Swab extraction and cell lysis were accomplished using magnetic-driven agitation of silica beads. Quantitative {PCR} ({qPCR}) (Roche Light Cycler 480) and {ddPCR} (Bio-Rad {QX}100 droplet digital {PCR} system) assays were used to detect genes for the staphylococcal protein {SA}0140 ({SA}) and the methicillin resistance ({mecA}) gene employing standard {TaqMan} chemistries. Both {qPCR} and {ddPCR} assays correctly identified culture controls for {MRSA} (76), {MSSA} (12), and confounder organisms (36) with 100\% sensitivity and specificity. Analysis of the clinical samples (211 negative and 186 positive) collected during a study of {MRSA} nasal carriage allowed direct comparison of the {qPCR} and {ddPCR} assays to the Cepheid {MRSA} {GeneXpert} assay. A total of 397 clinical samples were examined in this study. Cepheid {MRSA} {GeneXpert} values were used to define negative and positive samples. Both the {qPCR} and {ddPCR} assays were in good agreement with the reference assay. The sensitivities for the {qPCR} and {ddPCR} assays were 96.8\% (95\% confidence interval [{CI}], 93.1 to 98.5\%) and 96.8\% (95\% {CI}, 93.1 to 98.5\%), respectively. Both the {qPCR} and {ddPCR} assays had specificities of 91.9\% (95\% {CI}, 87.5 to 94.9\%) for {qPCR} and 91.0\% (95\% {CI}, 86.4 to 94.2\%) for {ddPCR} technology.},

  Abstract                 = {Cell-associated ({CA}) {HIV}-1 {RNA} is considered a potential marker for assessment of viral reservoir dynamics and antiretroviral therapy ({ART}) response in {HIV}-infected patients. Recent studies employed sensitive seminested real-time quantitative (q){PCR} to quantify {CA} {HIV}-1 {RNA}. Digital {PCR} has been recently described as an alternative {PCR}-based technique for absolute quantification with higher accuracy compared to {qPCR}. Here, a comparison was made between the droplet digital {PCR} ({ddPCR}) and the seminested {qPCR} for quantification of unspliced (us) and multiply spliced (ms) {CA} {HIV}-1 {RNA}. Synthetic {RNA} standards and {CA} {HIV}-1 {RNA} from infected patients on and off {ART} (N = 34) were quantified with both methods. Correlations were observed between the methods both for serially diluted synthetic standards ({usRNA}: R(2) = 0.97, {msRNA}: R(2) = 0.92) and patient-derived samples ({usRNA}: R(2) = 0.51, {msRNA}: R(2) = 0.87). Seminested {qPCR} showed better quantitative linearity, accuracy and sensitivity in the quantification of synthetic standards than {ddPCR}, especially in the lower quantification ranges. Both methods demonstrated equally high detection rate of {usRNA} in patient samples on and off {ART} (91\%), whereas {ddPCR} detected {msRNA} in larger proportion of samples from {ART}-treated patients (p = 0.13). We observed an average agreement between the methods for {usRNA} quantification in patient samples, albeit with a large standard deviation (bias = 0.05±0.75 log10). However, a bias of 0.94±0.36 log10 was observed for {msRNA}. No-template controls were consistently negative in the seminested {qPCR}, but yielded a positive {ddPCR} signal for some wells. Therefore, the false positive signals may have affected the detection power of {ddPCR} in this study. Digital {PCR} is promising for {HIV} nucleic acid quantification, but the false positive signals need further attention. Quantitative assays for {CA} {HIV} {RNA} have the potential to improve monitoring of patients on {ART} and to be used in clinical studies aimed at {HIV} eradication, but should be cross-validated by multiple laboratories prior to wider use.},

Increased throughput may be achieved by reducing the reaction volume and increasing processivity. We have designed a high-throughput microfluidic chip that encapsulates {PCR} reagents in millions of picoliter droplets in a continuous oil flow. The oil stream conducts the droplets through alternating denaturation and annealing zones, resulting in rapid (55-s cycles) and efficient {PCR} amplification. Inclusion of fluorescent probes in the {PCR} reaction mix permits the amplification process to be monitored within individual droplets at specific locations within the microfluidic chip. We show that amplification of a 245-bp adenovirus product can be detected and quantified in 35 min at starting template concentrations as low as 1 template molecule/167 droplets (0.003 pg/{microL}). The frequencies of positive reactions over a range of template concentrations agree closely with the frequencies predicted by Poisson statistics, demonstrating both the accuracy and sensitivity of this platform for limiting dilution and digital {PCR} applications.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a protocol using theoretical methods and free software to design and analyze multivolume digital {PCR} ({MV} digital {PCR}) devices; the theory and software are also applicable to design and analysis of dilution series in digital {PCR}. {MV} digital {PCR} minimizes the total number of wells required for "digital" (single molecule) measurements while maintaining high dynamic range and high resolution. In some examples, multivolume designs with fewer than 200 total wells are predicted to provide dynamic range with 5-fold resolution similar to that of single-volume designs requiring 12,000 wells. Mathematical techniques were utilized and expanded to maximize the information obtained from each experiment and to quantify performance of devices and were experimentally validated using the {SlipChip} platform. {MV} digital {PCR} was demonstrated to perform reliably, and results from wells of different volumes agreed with one another. No artifacts due to different surface-to-volume ratios were observed, and single molecule amplification in volumes ranging from 1 to 125 {nL} was self-consistent. The device presented here was designed to meet the testing requirements for measuring clinically relevant levels of {HIV} viral load at the point-of-care (in plasma, {\textless}500 molecules/{mL} to {\textgreater}1,000,000 molecules/{mL}), and the predicted resolution and dynamic range was experimentally validated using a control sequence of {DNA}. This approach simplifies digital {PCR} experiments, saves space, and thus enables multiplexing using separate areas for each sample on one chip, and facilitates the development of new high-performance diagnostic tools for resource-limited applications. The theory and software presented here are general and are applicable to designing and analyzing other digital analytical platforms including digital immunoassays and digital bacterial analysis. It is not limited to {SlipChip} and could also be useful for the design of systems on platforms including valve-based and droplet-based platforms. In a separate publication by Shen et al. (J. Am. Chem. Soc., 2011, {DOI}: 10.1021/ja2060116), this approach is used to design and test digital {RT}-{PCR} devices for quantifying {RNA}.},

  Abstract                 = {{BACKGROUND}: A genomewide genetic and mutational profile of a fetus was recently determined via deep sequencing of maternal plasma {DNA}. This technology could have important applications for noninvasive prenatal diagnosis ({NIPD}) of many monogenic diseases. Relative haplotype dosage ({RHDO}) analysis, a core step of this procedure, would allow one to elucidate the maternally inherited half of the fetal genome. For clinical applications, the cost and complexity of data analysis might be reduced via targeted application of this approach to selected genomic regions containing disease-causing genes. There is thus a need to explore the feasibility of performing {RHDO} analysis in a targeted manner.
{METHODS}: We performed target enrichment by using solution-phase hybridization followed by massively parallel sequencing of the β-globin gene region in 2 families undergoing prenatal diagnosis for β-thalassemia. We used digital {PCR} strategies to physically deduce parental haplotypes. Finally, we performed {RHDO} analysis with target-enriched sequencing data and parental haplotypes to reveal the β-thalassemic status for the fetuses.
{RESULTS}: A mean sequencing depth of 206-fold was achieved in the β-globin gene region by targeted sequencing of maternal plasma {DNA}. {RHDO} analysis was successful for the sequencing data obtained from the target-enriched samples, including a region in one of the families in which the parents had similar haplotype structures. Data analysis revealed that both fetuses were heterozygous carriers of β-thalassemia.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Targeted sequencing of maternal plasma {DNA} for {NIPD} of monogenic diseases is feasible.},

These methods are laborious and subject to a number of significant limitations that can make library calibration unreliable.

Recurrent or progressive tumors, analyzed in four patients, had the same molecular genotype as their primary. Increased {BRAF} copy number and activating {BRAF} mutations may be involved in the development of low-grade glioma via overactivation of the Ras/Raf pathway.

  Abstract                 = {Reference plasmids are an essential tool for the quantification of genetically modified ({GM}) events. Quantitative real-time {PCR} ({qPCR}) is the most commonly used method to characterize and quantify reference plasmids. However, the precision of this method is often limited by calibration curves, and {qPCR} data can be affected by matrix differences between the standards and samples. Here, we describe a digital {PCR} ({dPCR}) approach that can be used to accurately measure the novel reference plasmid {pKefeng}6 and quantify the unauthorized variety of {GM} rice Kefeng6, eliminating the issues associated with matrix effects in calibration curves. The {pKefeng}6 plasmid was used as a calibrant for the quantification of Kefeng6 rice by determining the copy numbers of event- (77 bp) and taxon-specific (68 bp) fragments, their ratios, and their concentrations. The plasmid was diluted to five different concentrations. The third sample (S3) was optimized for the quantification range of {dPCR} according to previous reports. The ratio between the two fragments was 1.005, which closely approximated the value certified by sequencing, and the concentration was found to be 792 copies/μL. This method was precise, with an {RSD} of {\textasciitilde}3\%. These findings demonstrate the advantages of using the {dPCR} method to characterize reference materials.},

Measuring {miRNA} expression levels in sputum could provide a potential approach for the diagnosis of lung cancer. The emerging digital {PCR} is a straightforward technique for precise, direct, and absolute quantification of nucleic acids. The objective of the study was to investigate whether digital {PCR} could be used to quantify {miRNAs} in sputum for lung cancer diagnosis.
{METHODS}: We first determined and compared dynamic ranges of digital {PCR} and conventional quantitative reverse transcriptase {PCR} ({qRT}-{PCR}) for {miRNA} quantification using {RNA} isolated from sputum of five healthy individuals. We then used digital {PCR} to quantify copy number of two lung cancer-associated {miRNAs} ({miR}-31 and {miR}-210) in 35 lung cancer patients and 40 cancer-free controls.
{RESULTS}: Copy number of the {miRNAs} measured by digital {PCR} displayed a linear response to input {cDNA} amount in a twofold dilution series over seven orders of magnitude. {miRNA} quantification determined by digital {PCR} assay was in good agreement with that obtained from {qRT}-{PCR} analysis in sputum. Furthermore, combined quantification of {miR}-31 and {miR}-210 copy number by using digital {PCR} in sputum of the cases and controls provided 65.71 \% sensitivity and 85.00 \% specificity for lung cancer diagnosis.
{CONCLUSION}: As digital {PCR} becomes more established, it would be a robust tool for quantitative assessment of {miRNA} copy number in sputum for lung cancer diagnosis.},

  Abstract                 = {{BACKGROUND}: The discovery of circulating cell-free fetal nucleic acids in maternal plasma has opened up new possibilities for noninvasive prenatal diagnosis. The potential application of this technology for the noninvasive prenatal detection of fetal chromosomal aneuploidies is an aspect of this field that is being actively investigated. The main challenge of work in this area is the fact that cell-free fetal nucleic acids represent only a minor fraction of the total nucleic acids in maternal plasma. Methods and
{RESULTS}: We performed a review of the literature, which revealed that investigators have applied methods based on the physical and molecular enrichment of fetal nucleic acid targets from maternal plasma. The former includes the use of size fractionation of plasma {DNA} and the use of the controversial formaldehyde treatment method. The latter has been achieved through the development of fetal epigenetic and fetal {RNA} markers. The aneuploidy status of the fetus has been explored through the use of allelic ratio analysis of plasma fetal epigenetic and {RNA} markers. Digital {PCR} has been shown to offer high precision for allelic ratio and relative chromosome dosage analyses.
{CONCLUSIONS}: After a decade of work, the theoretical and practical feasibility of prenatal fetal chromosomal aneuploidy detection by plasma nucleic acid analysis has been demonstrated in studies using small sample sets. Larger scale independent studies will be needed to validate these initial observations. If these larger scale studies prove successful, it is expected that with further development of new fetal {DNA}/{RNA} markers and new analytical methods, molecular noninvasive prenatal diagnosis of the major chromosomal aneuploidies could become a routine practice in the near future.},

  Abstract                 = {Trisomy 21 is the most common reason that women opt for prenatal diagnosis. Conventional prenatal diagnostic methods involve the sampling of fetal materials by invasive procedures such as amniocentesis. Screening by ultrasonography and biochemical markers have been used to risk-stratify pregnant women before definitive invasive diagnostic procedures. However, these screening methods generally target epiphenomena, such as nuchal translucency, associated with trisomy 21. It would be ideal if noninvasive genetic methods were available for the direct detection of the core pathology of trisomy 21. Here we outline an approach using digital {PCR} for the noninvasive detection of fetal trisomy 21 by analysis of fetal nucleic acids in maternal plasma. First, we demonstrate the use of digital {PCR} to determine the allelic imbalance of a {SNP} on {PLAC}4 {mRNA}, a placenta-expressed transcript on chromosome 21, in the maternal plasma of women bearing trisomy 21 fetuses. We named this the digital {RNA} {SNP} strategy. Second, we developed a nonpolymorphism-based method for the noninvasive prenatal detection of trisomy 21. We named this the digital relative chromosome dosage ({RCD}) method. Digital {RCD} involves the direct assessment of whether the total copy number of chromosome 21 in a sample containing fetal {DNA} is overrepresented with respect to a reference chromosome. Even without elaborate instrumentation, digital {RCD} allows the detection of trisomy 21 in samples containing 25\% fetal {DNA}. We applied the sequential probability ratio test to interpret the digital {PCR} data. Computer simulation and empirical validation confirmed the high accuracy of the disease classification algorithm.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Accurate titration of adeno-associated viral ({AAV}) vector genome copies is critical for ensuring correct and reproducible dosing in both preclinical and clinical settings. Quantitative {PCR} ({qPCR}) is the current method of choice for titrating {AAV} genomes because of the simplicity, accuracy, and robustness of the assay. However, issues with {qPCR}-based determination of self-complementary {AAV} vector genome titers, due to primer-probe exclusion through genome self-annealing or through packaging of prematurely terminated defective interfering ({DI}) genomes, have been reported. Alternative {qPCR}, gel-based, or Southern blotting titering methods have been designed to overcome these issues but may represent a backward step from standard {qPCR} methods in terms of simplicity, robustness, and precision. Droplet digital {PCR} ({ddPCR}) is a new {PCR} technique that directly quantifies {DNA} copies with an unparalleled degree of precision and without the need for a standard curve or for a high degree of amplification efficiency; all properties that lend themselves to the accurate quantification of both single-stranded and self-complementary {AAV} genomes. Here we compare a {ddPCR}-based {AAV} genome titer assay with a standard and an optimized {qPCR} assay for the titration of both single-stranded and self-complementary {AAV} genomes. We demonstrate absolute quantification of single-stranded {AAV} vector genomes by {ddPCR} with up to 4-fold increases in titer over a standard {qPCR} titration but with equivalent readout to an optimized {qPCR} assay. In the case of self-complementary vectors, {ddPCR} titers were on average 5-, 1.9-, and 2.3-fold higher than those determined by standard {qPCR}, optimized {qPCR}, and agarose gel assays, respectively. Droplet digital {PCR}-based genome titering was superior to {qPCR} in terms of both intra- and interassay precision and is more resistant to {PCR} inhibitors, a desirable feature for in-process monitoring of early-stage vector production and for vector genome biodistribution analysis in inhibitory tissues.},

  Abstract                 = {{BACKGROUND}: The precise measurement of cell-free fetal {DNA} in maternal plasma facilitates noninvasive prenatal diagnosis of fetal chromosomal aneuploidies and other applications. We tested the hypothesis that microfluidics digital {PCR}, in which individual fetal-{DNA} molecules are counted, could enhance the precision of measuring circulating fetal {DNA}.
{METHODS}: We first determined whether microfluidics digital {PCR}, real-time {PCR}, and mass spectrometry produced different estimates of male-{DNA} concentrations in artificial mixtures of male and female {DNA}. We then focused on comparing the imprecision of microfluidics digital {PCR} with that of a well-established nondigital {PCR} assay for measuring male fetal {DNA} in maternal plasma.
{RESULTS}: Of the tested platforms, microfluidics digital {PCR} demonstrated the least quantitative bias for measuring the fractional concentration of male {DNA}. This assay had a lower imprecision and higher clinical sensitivity compared with nondigital real-time {PCR}. With the {ZFY}/{ZFX} assay on the microfluidics digital {PCR} platform, the median fractional concentration of fetal {DNA} in maternal plasma was {\textgreater} or =2 times higher for all 3 trimesters of pregnancy than previously reported.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Microfluidics digital {PCR} represents an improvement over previous methods for quantifying fetal {DNA} in maternal plasma, enabling diagnostic and research applications requiring precise quantification. This approach may also impact other diagnostic applications of plasma nucleic acids, e.g., in oncology and transplantation.},

  Abstract                 = {Analysis of plasma {microRNAs} ({miRNAs}) by quantitative polymerase chain reaction ({qPCR}) provides a potential approach for cancer diagnosis. However, absolutely quantifying low abundant plasma {miRNAs} is challenging with {qPCR}. Digital {PCR} offers a unique means for assessment of nucleic acids presenting at low levels in plasma. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of digital {PCR} for quantification of plasma {miRNAs} and the potential utility of this technique for cancer diagnosis. We used digital {PCR} to quantify the copy number of plasma {microRNA}-21-5p ({miR}-21-5p) and {microRNA}-335-3p ({miR}-335-3p) in 36 lung cancer patients and 38 controls. Digital {PCR} showed a high degree of linearity and quantitative correlation with {miRNAs} in a dynamic range from 1 to 10,000 copies/?L of input, with high reproducibility. {qPCR} exhibited a dynamic range from 100 to 1×10(7) copies/?L of input. Digital {PCR} had a higher sensitivity to detect copy number of the {miRNAs} compared with {qPCR}. In plasma, digital {PCR} could detect copy number of both {miR}-21-5p and {miR}-335-3p, whereas {qPCR} was only able to assess {miR}-21-5p. Quantification of the plasma {miRNAs} by digital {PCR} provided 71.8\% sensitivity and 80.6\% specificity in distinguishing lung cancer patients from cancer-free subjects.},

  Abstract                 = {The great promise of digital PCR is the potential for unparalleled precision enabling accurate measurements for genetic quantification. A challenge associated with digital PCR experiments, when testing unknown samples, is to perform experiments at dilutions allowing the detection of one or more targets of interest at a desired level of precision. While theory states that optimal precision (Po) is achieved by targeting {\textasciitilde}1.59 mean copies per partition (e), and that dynamic range (R) includes the space spanning one positive (eL) to one negative (eU) result from the total number of partitions (n), these results are tempered for the practitioner seeking to construct digital PCR experiments in the laboratory. A mathematical framework is presented elucidating the relationships between precision, dynamic range, number of partitions, interrogated volume, and sensitivity in digital PCR. The impact that false reaction calls and volumetric variation have on sensitivity and precision is next considered. The resultant effects on sensitivity and precision are established via Monte Carlo simulations reflecting the real-world likelihood of encountering such scenarios in the laboratory. The simulations provide insight to the practitioner on how to adapt experimental loading concentrations to counteract any one of these conditions. The framework is augmented with a method of extending the dynamic range of digital PCR, with and without increasing n, via the use of dilutions. An example experiment demonstrating the capabilities of the framework is presented enabling detection across 3.33 logs of starting copy concentration.},

  Abstract                 = {Most cancer genomes are characterized by the gain or loss of copies of some sequences through deletion, amplification or unbalanced translocations. Delineating and quantifying these changes is important in understanding the initiation and progression of cancer, in identifying novel therapeutic targets, and in the diagnosis and prognosis of individual patients. Conventional methods for measuring copy-number are limited in their ability to analyse large numbers of loci, in their dynamic range and accuracy, or in their ability to analyse small or degraded samples. This latter limitation makes it difficult to access the wealth of fixed, archived material present in clinical collections, and also impairs our ability to analyse small numbers of selected cells from biopsies. Molecular copy-number counting ({MCC}), a digital {PCR} technique, has been used to delineate a non-reciprocal translocation using good quality {DNA} from a renal carcinoma cell line. We now demonstrate {microMCC}, an adaptation of {MCC} which allows the precise assessment of copy number variation over a significant dynamic range, in template {DNA} extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded clinical biopsies. Further, {microMCC} can accurately measure copy number variation at multiple loci, even when applied to picogram quantities of grossly degraded {DNA} extracted after laser capture microdissection of fixed specimens. Finally, we demonstrate the power of {microMCC} to precisely interrogate cancer genomes, in a way not currently feasible with other methodologies, by defining the position of a junction between an amplified and non-amplified genomic segment in a bronchial carcinoma. This has tremendous potential for the exploitation of archived resources for high-resolution targeted cancer genomics and in the future for interrogating multiple loci in cancer diagnostics or prognostics.},

The clinical endpoint is the development of multiple tumours, either simultaneously or sequentially in the same epithelial surface. The mechanisms underlying this process remain unclear; one possible explanation is that the epithelium is colonized by a clonal population of cells that are at increased risk of progression to cancer. We now address this possibility in a short case series, using individual genomic events as molecular biomarkers of clonality. In squamous lung cancer the most common genomic aberration is 3q amplification. We use a digital {PCR} technique to assess the clonal relationships between multiple biopsies in a longitudinal bronchoscopic study, using amplicon boundaries as markers of clonality. We demonstrate that clonality can readily be defined by these analyses and confirm that field cancerization occurs at a pre-invasive stage and that pre-invasive lesions and subsequent cancers are clonally related. We show that while the amplicon boundaries can be shared between different biopsies, the degree of 3q amplification and the internal structure of the 3q amplicon varies from lesion to lesion. Finally, in this small cohort, the degree of 3q amplification corresponds to clinical progression.},

Due to significant advancements in droplet chemistry and buoyed by the multiple benefits associated with dye-based target detection, we have created a "second generation" {ddPCR} system compatible with both {TaqMan}-probe and {DNA}-binding dye detection chemistries. Herein, we describe the operating characteristics of {DNA}-binding dye based {ddPCR} and offer a side-by-side comparison to {TaqMan} probe detection. By partitioning each sample prior to thermal cycling, we demonstrate that it is now possible to use a {DNA}-binding dye for the quantification of multiple target species from a single reaction. The increased resolution associated with partitioning also made it possible to visualize and account for signals arising from nonspecific amplification products. We expect that the ability to combine the precision of {ddPCR} with both {DNA}-binding dye and {TaqMan} probe detection chemistries will further enable the research community to answer complex and diverse genetic questions.},

  Abstract                 = {In this study, we present a highly customizable method for quantifying copy number and point mutations utilizing a single-color, droplet digital {PCR} platform. Droplet digital polymerase chain reaction ({ddPCR}) is rapidly replacing real-time quantitative {PCR} ({qRT}-{PCR}) as an efficient method of independent {DNA} quantification. Compared to quantative {PCR}, {ddPCR} eliminates the needs for traditional standards; instead, it measures target and reference {DNA} within the same well. The applications for {ddPCR} are widespread including targeted quantitation of genetic aberrations, which is commonly achieved with a two-color fluorescent oligonucleotide probe ({TaqMan}) design. However, the overall cost and need for optimization can be greatly reduced with an alternative method of distinguishing between target and reference products using the nonspecific {DNA} binding properties of {EvaGreen} ({EG}) dye. By manipulating the length of the target and reference amplicons, we can distinguish between their fluorescent signals and quantify each independently. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method by examining copy number in the proto-oncogene {FLT}3 and the common V600E point mutation in {BRAF}. Using a series of well-characterized control samples and cancer cell lines, we confirmed the accuracy of our method in quantifying mutation percentage and integer value copy number changes. As another novel feature, our assay was able to detect a mutation comprising less than 1\% of an otherwise wild-type sample, as well as copy number changes from cancers even in the context of significant dilution with normal {DNA}. This flexible and cost-effective method of independent {DNA} quantification proves to be a robust alternative to the commercialized {TaqMan} assay.},

Released by pancreatic ? cells, insulin passes the blood-brain barrier, but sources of locally released insulin still remain unclear. We find that insulin is strongly expressed in {GABAergic} neurogliaform cells in the cerebral cortex of the rat detected by single-cell digital {PCR}. Focal application of glucose or glibenclamide to neurogliaform cells mimics the excitation suppressing effect of external insulin on local microcircuits via insulin receptors. Thus, neurogliaform cells might link {GABAergic} and insulinergic action in cortical microcircuits.},

Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction ({qPCR}) is currently used for quantitative molecular analysis of the presence of {GMOs} in products. However, its use is limited for detecting and quantifying very small numbers of {DNA} targets, as in some complex food and feed matrices. Using {ddPCR} duplex assay, we have measured the absolute numbers of {MON}810 transgene and hmg maize reference gene copies in {DNA} samples. Key performance parameters of the assay were determined. The {ddPCR} system is shown to offer precise absolute and relative quantification of targets, without the need for calibration curves. The sensitivity (five target {DNA} copies) of the {ddPCR} assay compares well with those of individual {qPCR} assays and of the chamber digital {PCR} ({cdPCR}) approach. It offers a dynamic range over four orders of magnitude, greater than that of {cdPCR}. Moreover, when compared to {qPCR}, the {ddPCR} assay showed better repeatability at low target concentrations and a greater tolerance to inhibitors. Finally, {ddPCR} throughput and cost are advantageous relative to those of {qPCR} for routine {GMO} quantification. It is thus concluded that {ddPCR} technology can be applied for routine quantification of {GMOs}, or any other domain where quantitative analysis of food and feed samples is needed.},

  Abstract                 = {For the analysis of cancer, there is great interest in rapid and accurate detection of cancer genome amplifications containing oncogenes that are potential therapeutic targets. The vast majority of cancer tissue samples are formalin fixed and paraffin embedded ({FFPE}) which enables histopathological examination and long term archiving. However, {FFPE} cancer genomic {DNA} is oftentimes degraded and generally a poor substrate for many molecular biology assays. To overcome the issues of poor {DNA} quality from {FFPE} samples and detect oncogenic copy number amplifications with high accuracy and sensitivity, we developed a novel approach. Our assay requires nanogram amounts of genomic {DNA}, thus facilitating study of small amounts of clinical samples. Using droplet digital {PCR} ({ddPCR}), we can determine the relative copy number of specific genomic loci even in the presence of intermingled normal tissue. We used a control dilution series to determine the limits of detection for the {ddPCR} assay and report its improved sensitivity on minimal amounts of {DNA} compared to standard real-time {PCR}. To develop this approach, we designed an assay for the fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 gene ({FGFR}2) that is amplified in a gastric and breast cancers as well as others. We successfully utilized {ddPCR} to ascertain {FGFR}2 amplifications from {FFPE}-preserved gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas.},

  Abstract                 = {{OBJECTIVES}: To study the ability of a stabilizing reagent to prevent cellular {DNA} contamination of cell-free {DNA} ({cfDNA}) in plasma during whole blood sample storage and shipping.
{DESIGN} {AND} {METHODS}: Samples were drawn from healthy donors into K?{EDTA} and Cell-Free {DNA} {BCTs} ({BCT}) and stored at room temperature ({RT}). Aliquots were removed at specified time points and {cfDNA} was purified from the plasma. A Droplet Digital {PCR} ({ddPCR}) assay that amplifies a short ?-actin gene fragment (136 bp) was used to measure the total plasma {cfDNA} ({pDNA}) concentration while a longer ?-actin fragment (420 bp) was used to quantify genomic {DNA} ({gDNA}). In a follow-up experiment, blood samples drawn into the same types of tubes were shipped round trip by overnight air before {cfDNA} was isolated and analyzed.
{RESULTS}: Blood stored in K?{EDTA} tubes at {RT} showed increases in {pDNA} and {gDNA} concentrations over time. However, both {pDNA} and {gDNA} levels remained stable in {BCT} for at least seven days. On day 14, there was a 4.5-fold increase in {pDNA} in {BCT} as compared to {\textgreater}200-fold increase in K?{EDTA} tubes. Likewise, {gDNA} increased {\textless}2-fold on day 14 in {BCT} as opposed to a 456-fold increase in K?{EDTA} tubes. Similar results were observed after samples were shipped.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Cell-Free {DNA} {BCTs} prevent {gDNA} contamination that may occur due to nucleated cell disruption during sample storage and shipping. This novel blood collection tube provides a method for obtaining stable {cfDNA} samples for rare target detection and accurate analysis while mitigating the threat of {gDNA} contamination.},

  Abstract                 = {Merkel cell polyomavirus ({MCPyV}) has recently been identified in Merkel cell carcinoma ({MCC}), an aggressive cancer that occurs in sun-exposed skin. Conventional technologies, such as polymerase chain reaction ({PCR}) and immunohistochemistry, have produced conflicting results for {MCPyV} infections in non-{MCC} tumors. Therefore, we performed quantitative analyses of the {MCPyV} copy number in various skin tumor tissues, including {MCC} (n?=?9) and other sun exposure-related skin tumors (basal cell carcinoma [{BCC}, n?=?45], actinic keratosis [{AK}, n?=?52], Bowen's disease [n?=?34], seborrheic keratosis [n?=?5], primary cutaneous anaplastic large-cell lymphoma [n?=?5], malignant melanoma [n?=?5], and melanocytic nevus [n?=?6]). In a conventional {PCR} analysis, {MCPyV} {DNA} was detected in {MCC} (9 cases; 100\%), {BCC} (1 case; 2\%), and {AK} (3 cases; 6\%). We then used digital {PCR} technology to estimate the absolute viral copy number per haploid human genome in these tissues. The viral copy number per haploid genome was estimated to be around 1 in most {MCC} tissues, and there were marked differences between the {MCC} (0.119-42.8) and {AK} (0.02-0.07) groups. {PCR}-positive {BCC} tissue showed a similar viral load as {MCC} tissue (0.662). Immunohistochemistry with a monoclonal antibody against the {MCPyV} T antigen ({CM}2B4) demonstrated positive nuclear localization in most of the high-viral-load tumor groups (8 of 9 {MCC} and 1 {BCC}), but not in the low-viral-load or {PCR}-negative tumor groups. These results demonstrated that {MCPyV} infection is possibly involved in a minority of sun-exposed skin tumors, including {BCC} and {AK}, and that these tumors display different modes of infection.},

  Abstract                 = {{PURPOSE}: Tumor genotyping using cell-free plasma {DNA} ({cfDNA}) has the potential to allow noninvasive assessment of tumor biology, yet many existing assays are cumbersome and vulnerable to false-positive results. We sought to determine whether droplet digital {PCR} ({ddPCR}) of {cfDNA} would allow highly specific and quantitative assessment of tumor genotype.
{EXPERIMENTAL} {DESIGN}: {ddPCR} assays for {EGFR}, {KRAS}, and {BRAF} mutations were developed using plasma collected from patients with advanced lung cancer or melanoma of a known tumor genotype. Sensitivity and specificity were determined using cancers with nonoverlapping genotypes as positive and negative controls. Serial assessment of response and resistance was studied in patients with {EGFR}-mutant lung cancer on a prospective trial of erlotinib.
{RESULTS}: We identified a reference range for {EGFR} L858R and exon 19 deletions in specimens from {KRAS}-mutant lung cancer, allowing identification of candidate thresholds with high sensitivity and 100\% specificity. Received operative characteristic curve analysis of four assays demonstrated an area under the curve in the range of 0.80 to 0.94. Sensitivity improved in specimens with optimal {cfDNA} concentrations. Serial plasma genotyping of {EGFR}-mutant lung cancer on erlotinib demonstrated pretreatment detection of {EGFR} mutations, complete plasma response in most cases, and increasing levels of {EGFR} T790M emerging before objective progression.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Noninvasive genotyping of {cfDNA} using {ddPCR} demonstrates assay qualities that could allow effective translation into a clinical diagnostic. Serial quantification of plasma genotype allows noninvasive assessment of response and resistance, including detection of resistance mutations up to 16 weeks before radiographic progression.

  Abstract                 = {Real-time quantitative polymerase-chain-reaction (qPCR) is a standard technique in most laboratories used for various applications in basic research. Analysis of qPCR data is a crucial part of the entire experiment, which has led to the development of a plethora of methods. The released tools either cover specific parts of the workflow or provide complete analysis solutions.

Here, we surveyed 27 open-access software packages and tools for the analysis of qPCR data. The survey includes 8 Microsoft Windows, 5 web-based, 9 R-based and 5 tools from other platforms. Reviewed packages and tools support the analysis of different qPCR applications, such as RNA quantification, DNA methylation, genotyping, identification of copy number variations, and digital PCR. We report an overview of the functionality, features and specific requirements of the individual software tools, such as data exchange formats, availability of a graphical user interface, included procedures for graphical data presentation, and offered statistical methods. In addition, we provide an overview about quantification strategies, and report various applications of qPCR.

Our comprehensive survey showed that most tools use their own file format and only a fraction of the currently existing tools support the standardized data exchange format RDML. To allow a more streamlined and comparable analysis of qPCR data, more vendors and tools need to adapt the standardized format to encourage the exchange of data between instrument software, analysis tools, and researchers.},

In addition, the review explores the usefulness of these methods in determining the effectiveness of new {HIV}-1 eradication strategies in purging persistent {HIV}-1 reservoirs.
{RECENT} {FINDINGS}: Quantification of plasma {HIV}-1 {RNA} levels remains essential for determining the success of combination antiretroviral therapy ({cART}) in treated patients. Recently, several new platforms with improved sensitivity for quantifying {HIV}-1 {RNA} have been developed and the application of these assays has revealed that low-level viremia persists in patients on suppressive therapy. In addition, new technological advances such as digital {PCR} have been proposed to increase the sensitivity of measuring and characterizing persistent {HIV}-1 viremia. The application of these assays will be important in determining the effectiveness of future {HIV}-1 eradication strategies.
{SUMMARY}: The level of {HIV}-1 {RNA} in patient plasma remains an important marker for determining the success of {cART}. New sensitive assays have found that {HIV}-1 persists in the plasma of patients on suppressive therapy that may have implications for the clinical management of this disease and strategies for eliminating {HIV}-1 infection.},

  Abstract                 = {Somatic mutations within tumoral {DNA} can be used as highly specific biomarkers to distinguish cancer cells from their normal counterparts. These {DNA} biomarkers are potentially useful for the diagnosis, prognosis, treatment and follow-up of patients. In order to have the required sensitivity and specificity to detect rare tumoral {DNA} in stool, blood, lymph and other patient samples, a simple, sensitive and quantitative procedure to measure the ratio of mutant to wild-type genes is required. However, techniques such as dual probe {TaqMan}(®) assays and pyrosequencing, while quantitative, cannot detect less than ?1\% mutant genes in a background of non-mutated {DNA} from normal cells. Here we describe a procedure allowing the highly sensitive detection of mutated {DNA} in a quantitative manner within complex mixtures of {DNA}. The method is based on using a droplet-based microfluidic system to perform digital {PCR} in millions of picolitre droplets. Genomic {DNA} ({gDNA}) is compartmentalized in droplets at a concentration of less than one genome equivalent per droplet together with two {TaqMan}(®) probes, one specific for the mutant and the other for the wild-type {DNA}, which generate green and red fluorescent signals, respectively. After thermocycling, the ratio of mutant to wild-type genes is determined by counting the ratio of green to red droplets. We demonstrate the accurate and sensitive quantification of mutated {KRAS} oncogene in {gDNA}. The technique enabled the determination of mutant allelic specific imbalance ({MASI}) in several cancer cell-lines and the precise quantification of a mutated {KRAS} gene in the presence of a 200,000-fold excess of unmutated {KRAS} genes. The sensitivity is only limited by the number of droplets analyzed. Furthermore, by one-to-one fusion of drops containing {gDNA} with any one of seven different types of droplets, each containing a {TaqMan}(®) probe specific for a different {KRAS} mutation, or wild-type {KRAS}, and an optical code, it was possible to screen the six common mutations in {KRAS} codon 12 in parallel in a single experiment.},

  Abstract                 = {Drug resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis presents an enormous public health threat. It is typically defined as {\textgreater}1\% of drug resistant colonies using the agar proportion method. Detecting small numbers of drug resistant Tb in a population, also known as heteroresistance, is challenging with current methodologies. Here we have utilized digital {PCR} to detect heteroresistance within M. tuberculosis populations with excellent accuracy versus the agar proportion method. We designed dual {TaqMan}-{MGB} probes to detect wild-type and mutant sequences of {katG} (315), {rpoB} (531), {gyrA} (94,95) and rrs (1401), genes that associate with resistance to isoniazid, rifampin, fluoroquinolone, and aminoglycoside respectively. We generated heteroresistant mixtures of susceptible and extensively drug resistant Tb, followed by {DNA} extraction and digital {PCR}. Digital {PCR} yielded a close approximation to agar proportion's percentages of resistant colonies, and yielded 100\% concordance with agar proportion's susceptible/resistant results. Indeed, the digital {PCR} method was able to identify mutant sequence in mixtures containing as little as 1000?1 susceptible:resistant Tb. By contrast, real-time {PCR} or {PCR} followed by Sanger sequencing were less sensitive and had little resolution to detect heteroresistance, requiring fully 1?1 or 10?1 susceptible:resistant ratios in order to detect resistance. Our assay can also work in sputum so long as sufficient quantities of Tb are present ({\textgreater}1000 cfu/ml). This work demonstrates the utility of digital {PCR} to detect and quantify heteroresistance in drug resistant Tb, which may be useful to inform treatment decisions faster than agar proportion.},

The technique is to amplify a single {DNA} template from minimally diluted samples, therefore generating amplicons that are exclusively derived from one template and can be detected with different fluorophores or sequencing to discriminate different alleles (e.g., wild type vs. mutant or paternal vs. maternal alleles). Thus, digital {PCR} transforms the exponential, analog signals obtained from conventional {PCR} to linear, digital signals, allowing statistical analysis of the {PCR} product. Digital {PCR} has been applied in quantification of mutant alleles and detection of allelic imbalance in clinical specimens, providing a promising molecular diagnostic tool for cancer detection.

The main scope of this work was the transcriptome profiling of genes on human chromosome 18 (Chr 18), as well as their encoded proteome, from three types of biomaterials: liver tissue, the hepatocellular carcinoma-derived cell line {HepG}2, and blood plasma. The transcriptome profiling for liver tissue was independently performed using two {RNaseq} platforms ({SOLiD} and Illumina) and also by droplet digital {PCR} ({ddPCR}) and quantitative {RT}-{PCR}. The proteome profiling of Chr 18 was accomplished by quantitatively measuring protein copy numbers in the three types of biomaterial (the lowest protein concentration measured was 10(-13) M) using selected reaction monitoring ({SRM}). In total, protein copy numbers were estimated for 228 master proteins, including quantitative data on 164 proteins in plasma, 171 in the {HepG}2 cell line, and 186 in liver tissue. Most proteins were present in plasma at 10(8) copies/?L, while the median abundance was 10(4) and 10(5) protein copies per cell in {HepG}2 cells and liver tissue, respectively. In summary, for liver tissue and {HepG}2 cells a "transcriptoproteome" was produced that reflects the relationship between transcript and protein copy numbers of the genes on Chr 18. The quantitative data acquired by {RNaseq}, {PCR}, and {SRM} were uploaded into the "Update\_2013" data set of our knowledgebase (www.kb18.ru) and investigated for linear correlations.},

The {DNA} copy number of wild-type α-globin gene allele and α(0)-thalassemia {SEA} allele was then calculated using the Quantasoft analysis software.
{RESULTS}: The mean ± standard deviation ({SD}) ratio of wild-type α-globin gene allele and α(0)-thalassemia {SEA} allele among normal individuals, samples with α(0)-thalassemia {SEA} trait, and Bart's hydrops fetalis were clearly distinguished with levels of 1.78 ± 0.49, 0.85 ± 0.14, and 0.03 ± 0.03, respectively.
{CONCLUSION}: The {ddPCR} may be one alternative technology available for routine clinical diagnosis of α(0)-thalassemia {SEA}-type deletion and prenatal diagnosis of Bart's hydrops fetalis.},

Here we report the use of single-molecule methods to sequence an individual human genome. We aligned billions of 24- to 70-bp reads (32 bp average) to approximately 90\% of the National Center for Biotechnology Information ({NCBI}) reference genome, with 28x average coverage. Our results were obtained on one sequencing instrument by a single operator with four data collection runs. Single-molecule sequencing enabled analysis of human genomic information without the need for cloning, amplification or ligation. We determined approximately 2.8 million single nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNPs}) with a false-positive rate of less than 1\% as validated by Sanger sequencing and 99.8\% concordance with {SNP} genotyping arrays. We identified 752 regions of copy number variation by analyzing coverage depth alone and validated 27 of these using digital {PCR}. This milestone should allow widespread application of genome sequencing to many aspects of genetics and human health, including personal genomics.},

  Abstract                 = {To digitally analyze expression levels of multiple genes in one reaction, we proposed a method termed as '{MDHB}' (Multiplexed Digital-{PCR} coupled with Hydrogel Bead-array). The template for bead-based emulsion {PCR} ({emPCR}) was prepared by reverse transcription using sequence-tagged primers. The beads recovered from {emPCR} were immobilized with hydrogel to form a single-bead layer on a chip, and then decoded by gene-specific probe hybridization and Cy3-{dUTP} based primer extension reaction. The specificity of probe hybridization was improved by using electrophoresis to remove mismatched probes on the bead's surface. The number of positive beads reflects the abundance of expressed genes; the expression levels of target genes were normalized to a housekeeping gene and expressed as the number ratio of green beads to red beads. The discrimination limit of {MDHB} is 0.1\% (i.e., one target molecule from 1000 background molecules), and the sensitivity of the method is below 100 cells when using the ?-actin gene as the detection target. We have successfully employed {MDHB} to detect the relative expression levels of four colorectal cancer ({CRC})-related genes (c-myc, {COX}-2, {MMP}7, and {DPEP}1) in 8 tissue samples and 9 stool samples from {CRC} patients, giving the detection rates of 100\% and 77\%, respectively. The results suggest that {MDHB} could be a potential tool for early non-invasive diagnosis of {CRC}.},

  Abstract                 = {Motivation: Both the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and quantitative isothermal amplification (qIA) are standard methods for nucleic acid quantification. Numerous real-time read-out technologies have been developed. Despite the continuous interest in amplification-based techniques, there are only few tools for pre-processing of amplification data. However, a transparent tool for precise control of raw data is indispensable in several scenarios, for example, during the development of new instruments.Results: chipPCR is an R package for the pre-processing and quality analysis of raw data of amplification curves. The package takes advantage of R’s S4 object model and offers an extensible environment. chipPCR contains tools for raw data exploration: normalization, baselining, imputation of missing values, a powerful wrapper for amplification curve smoothing and a function to detect the start and end of an amplification curve. The capabilities of the software are enhanced by the implementation of algorithms unavailable in R, such as a 5-point stencil for derivative interpolation. Simulation tools, statistical tests, plots for data quality management, amplification efficiency/quantification cycle calculation, and datasets from qPCR and qIA experiments are part of the package. Core functionalities are integrated in GUIs (web-based and standalone shiny applications), thus streamlining analysis and report generation.Availability and implementation: http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/chipPCR.

  Abstract                 = {Microbead-based technologies represent elegant and versatile approaches for highly parallelized quantitative multiparameter assays. They also form the basis of various techniques for detection and quantification of nucleic acids and proteins. Nucleic acid-based methods include hybridization assays, solid-phase PCR, sequencing, and trapping assays. Microbead assays have been improved in the past decades and are now important tools in routine and point-of-care diagnostics as well as in life science. Its advances include low costs, low workload, high speed and high-throughput automation. The potential of microbead-based assays therefore is apparent, and commercial applications can be found in the detection and discrimination of single nucleotide polymorphism, of pathogens, and in trapping assays. This review provides an overview on microbead-based platforms for biosensing with a main focus on nucleic acid detection (including amplification strategies and on selected probe systems using fluorescent labeling). Specific sections cover chemical properties of microbeads, the coupling of targets onto solid surfaces, microbead probe systems (mainly oligonucleotide probes), microbead detection schemes (with subsections on suspension arrays, microfluidic devices, and immobilized microbeads), quantification of nucleic acids, PCR in solution and the detection of amplicons, and methods for solid-phase amplification. We discuss selected trends such as microbead-coupled amplification, heterogeneous and homogenous DNA hybridization assays, real-time assays, melting curve analysis, and digital microbead assays. We finally discuss the relevance and trends of the methods in terms of high-level multiplexed analysis and their potential in diagnosis and personalized medicine. Contains 211 references. Figure e},

Due to the discovery of new molecules and new emerging bioanalytical problems, there is an ongoing demand for a technology platform that provides a broad range of assays with a user-friendly flexibility and rapid adaptability to new applications. Here we describe a highly versatile microscopy platform, VideoScan, for the rapid and simultaneous analysis of various assay formats based on fluorescence microscopic detection. The technological design is equally suitable for assays in solution, microbead-based assays and cell pattern recognition. The multiplex real-time capability for tracking of changes under dynamic heating conditions makes it a useful tool for PCR applications and nucleic acid hybridization, enabling kinetic data acquisition impossible to obtain by other technologies using endpoint detection. The paper discusses the technological principle of the platform regarding data acquisition and processing. Microbead-based and solution applications for the detection of diverse biomolecules, including antigens, antibodies, peptides, oligonucleotides and amplicons in small reaction volumes, are presented together with a high-content detection of autoimmune antibodies using a HEp-2 cell assay. Its adaptiveness and versatility gives VideoScan a competitive edge over other bioanalytical technologies.},

  Abstract                 = {{BACKGROUND}: Neurofibromatosis type 1 ({NF}1) is the most common hereditary neurocutaneous disorder and it is associated with an elevated risk for malignant tumors of tissues derived from neural crest cells. The {NF}1 gene is considered a tumor suppressor gene and inactivation of both copies can be found in {NF}1-associated benign and malignant tumors. Melanocytes also derive from neural crest cells but melanoma incidence is not markedly elevated in {NF}1. In this study we could analyze a typical superficial spreading melanoma of a 15-year-old boy with {NF}1 for loss of heterozygosity ({LOH}) within the {NF}1 gene. Neurofibromatosis in this patient was transmitted by the boy's farther who carried the mutation {NF}1 c. 5546 G/A.
{RESULTS}: Melanoma cells were isolated from formalin-fixed tissue by liquid coverslip laser microdissection. In order to obtain statistically significant {LOH} data, digital {PCR} was performed at the intragenic microsatellite {IVS}27AC28 with {DNA} of approx. 3500 melanoma cells. Digital {PCR} detected 23 paternal alleles and one maternal allele. Statistical analysis by {SPRT} confirmed significance of the maternal allele loss.
{CONCLUSION}: To our knowledge, this is the first molecular evidence of inactivation of both copies of the {NF}1 gene in a typical superficial spreading melanoma of a patient with {NF}1. The classical double-hit inactivation of the {NF}1 gene suggests that the {NF}1 genetic background promoted melanoma genesis in this patient.},

Similarly, accurate quantitation of phage is performed typically by counting plaques, a method that is tedious, low-throughput, and not amenable easily to high titers. In this report it is demonstrated that commercially available Zeba Spin Desalting Columns are useful devices for the efficient separation of small molecules from bacteriophage, which pass through almost unimpeded and remain infectious. It is shown further that digital {PCR} on microfluidic chips is a fast and accurate high-throughput technique to determine phage genome concentrations precisely.},

  Abstract                 = {Droplet digital {PCR} ({ddPCR}) is an emulsion {PCR} process that performs absolute quantitation of nucleic acids. We developed a {ddPCR} assay for Chlamydia trachomatis infections and found it to be accurate and precise. Using {PCR} mixtures containing plasmids engineered to include the {PCR} target sequences, we were able to quantify with a dynamic range between 0.07 and 3,160 targets/μl (r(2) = 0.9927) with {\textgreater}95\% confidence. Using 1,509 clinical conjunctival swab samples from a population in which trachoma is endemic in Guinea Bissau, we evaluated the specificity and sensitivity of the quantitative {ddPCR} assay in diagnosing ocular C. trachomatis infections by comparing the performances of {ddPCR} and the Roche Amplicor {CT}/{NG} test. We defined {ddPCR} tests as positive when we had ≥95\% confidence in a nonzero estimate of target load. The sensitivity of {ddPCR} against Amplicor was 73.3\% (95\% confidence interval [{CI}], 67.9 to 78.7\%), and specificity was 99.1\% (95\% {CI}, 98.6 to 99.6\%). Negative and positive predictive values were 94.6\% (95\% {CI}, 93.4 to 95.8\%) and 94.5\% (95\% {CI}, 91.3 to 97.7\%), respectively. Based on Amplicor {CT}/{NG} testing, the estimated population prevalence of C. trachomatis ocular infection was ∼17.5\%. Receiver-operator curve analysis was used to select critical cutoff values for use in clinical settings in which a balance between higher sensitivity and specificity is required. We concluded that {ddPCR} is an effective diagnostic technology suitable for both research and clinical use in diagnosing ocular C. trachomatis infections.},

The monitoring chemistries currently available can be categorized into six groups: (A) {DNA-binding} dyes; (B) hybridization probes; (C) hydrolysis probes; (D) {LUX} primers; (E) hairpin primers; and (F) the {QZyme} system. We have determined the kinetics of the increase in fluorescence for each of these groups with respect to the input of both ds-{DNA} and ss-{cDNA.} For the latter, we also evaluated {mRNA} and {cDNA} targeting probes or primers. This analysis revealed three situations. Hydrolysis probes and {LUX} primers, compared to {DNA-binding} dyes, do not require a correction of the observed quantification cycle. Hybridization probes and hairpin primers require a correction of −1 cycle (dubbed C-lag), while the {QZyme} system requires the C-lag correction and an efficiency-dependent C-shift correction. A {PCR} efficiency value can be derived from the relative increase in fluorescence in the exponential phase of the amplification curve for all monitoring chemistries. In case of hydrolysis probes, {LUX} primers and hairpin primers, however, this should be performed after cycle 12, and for the {QZyme} system after cycle 19, to keep the overestimation of the {PCR} efficiency below 0.5 \%. Figure The {qPCR} monitoring chemistries form six groups with distinct fluorescence kinetics. The displacement of the amplification curve depends on the chemistry, {DNA} input and probe-targeting. The observed shift in Cq values can be corrected and {PCR} efficiencies can be derived.},

  Abstract                 = {{RNA} transcripts such as {mRNA} or {microRNA} are frequently used as biomarkers to determine disease state or response to therapy. Reverse transcription ({RT)} in combination with quantitative {PCR} ({qPCR)} has become the method of choice to quantify small amounts of such {RNA} molecules. In parallel with the democratization of {RT-qPCR} and its increasing use in biomedical research or biomarker discovery, we witnessed a growth in the number of gene expression data analysis methods. Most of these methods are based on the principle that the position of the amplification curve with respect to the cycle-axis is a measure for the initial target quantity: the later the curve, the lower the target quantity. However, most methods differ in the mathematical algorithms used to determine this position, as well as in the way the efficiency of the {PCR} reaction (the fold increase of product per cycle) is determined and applied in the calculations. Moreover, there is dispute about whether the {PCR} efficiency is constant or continuously decreasing. Together this has lead to the development of different methods to analyze amplification curves. In published comparisons of these methods, available algorithms were typically applied in a restricted or outdated way, which does not do them justice. Therefore, we aimed at development of a framework for robust and unbiased assessment of curve analysis performance whereby various publicly available curve analysis methods were thoroughly compared using a previously published large clinical data set (Vermeulen et al., 2009) [11]. The original developers of these methods applied their algorithms and are co-author on this study. We assessed the curve analysis methods' impact on transcriptional biomarker identification in terms of expression level, statistical significance, and patient-classification accuracy. The concentration series per gene, together with data sets from unpublished technical performance experiments, were analyzed in order to assess the algorithms' precision, bias, and resolution. While large differences exist between methods when considering the technical performance experiments, most methods perform relatively well on the biomarker data. The data and the analysis results per method are made available to serve as benchmark for further development and evaluation of {qPCR} curve analysis methods ({http://qPCRDataMethods.hfrc.nl).}},

This is especially true for the handling of the fluorescence baseline. This article shows that baseline estimation errors are directly reflected in the observed {PCR} efficiency values and are thus propagated exponentially in the estimated starting concentrations as well as 'fold-difference' results. Because of the unknown origin and kinetics of the baseline fluorescence, the fluorescence values monitored in the initial cycles of the {PCR} reaction cannot be used to estimate a useful baseline value. An algorithm that estimates the baseline by reconstructing the log-linear phase downward from the early plateau phase of the {PCR} reaction was developed and shown to lead to very reproducible {PCR} efficiency values. {PCR} efficiency values were determined per sample by fitting a regression line to a subset of data points in the log-linear phase. The variability, as well as the bias, in {qPCR} results was significantly reduced when the mean of these {PCR} efficiencies per amplicon was used in the calculation of an estimate of the starting concentration per sample.},

We used various {DNA} templates, matrixes, and assays to evaluate the precision, sensitivity and reproducibility of {dPCR}, and demonstrate that this technique can be highly reproducible when performed at different times and when different primer sets are targeting the same molecule. {dPCR} exhibited good analytical sensitivity and was reproducible outside the range recommended by the instrument manufacturer; detecting 16 estimated targets with high precision. The inclusion of carrier had no effect on this estimated quantity, but did improve measurement precision. We report disagreement when using {dPCR} to measure different template types and when comparing the estimated quantities by {dPCR} and {UV} spectrophotometry.

Reverse transcription ({RT}), necessary for generating complementary {DNA}, can be both inefficient and imprecise, but remains a quintessential {RNA} analysis tool using {qPCR}. This study developed a Transcriptomic Calibration Material and assessed the {RT} reaction using digital (d){PCR} for {RNA} measurement. While many studies characterise {dPCR} capabilities for {DNA} quantification, less work has been performed investigating similar parameters using {RT}-{dPCR} for {RNA} analysis. {RT}-{dPCR} measurement using three, one-step {RT}-{qPCR} kits was evaluated using single and multiplex formats when measuring endogenous and synthetic {RNAs}. The best performing kit was compared to {UV} quantification and sensitivity and technical reproducibility investigated. Our results demonstrate assay and kit dependent {RT}-{dPCR} measurements differed significantly compared to {UV} quantification. Different values were reported by different kits for each target, despite evaluation of identical samples using the same instrument. {RT}-{dPCR} did not display the strong inter-assay agreement previously described when analysing {DNA}. This study demonstrates that, as with {DNA} measurement, {RT}-{dPCR} is capable of accurate quantification of low copy {RNA} targets, but the results are both kit and target dependent supporting the need for calibration controls.},

Development and evaluation of a next-generation digital {PCR} diagnostic assay for ocular chlamydia trachomatis infections. J. Clin. Microbiol. 51(7), 2195-2203 (2013). Trachoma is the leading infectious cause of blindness in developing countries. Currently, there is no program to eliminate blinding trachoma as a public health problem. We need better diagnostic tests for research and to assess progress in control programs. Roberts et al. adapted droplet digital {PCR} ({ddPCR}), an emulsion {PCR} process that performs absolute quantitation of nucleic acids, to detect and quantify Chlamydia trachomatis infections. They compared the results with {ddPCR} on conjunctival swab specimens collected in trachoma-endemic area to results using Roche's Amplicor® C. trachomatis/Neisseria gonorrhoeae ({CT}/{NG}) {PCR} and found that {ddPCR} sensitivity was 73.3\%. The authors concluded that '{ddPCR} is an effective diagnostic technology suitable for both research and clinical use in diagnosing ocular C. trachomatis infections'. This reviewer disagrees, feeling that if the stated sensitivity is accurate, it is too low, and suggests there may be good reasons to adapt commercially available tests for this purpose.},

  Abstract                 = {{BACKGROUND}: Human herpesvirus 6 ({HHV}-6) latently infects a majority of adults. In about 1\% of the population {HHV}-6 exists in a chromosomally integrated form ({ciHHV}-6) that resides in every somatic and germ cell and can be transmitted through the germ line. Patients with {ciHHV}-6 have been misdiagnosed and unnecessarily treated for active {HHV}-6 infection, sometimes with important side effects, based on results from quantitative molecular {HHV}-6 tests.{METHODS}: A droplet digital {PCR} ({ddPCR}) assay was developed to identify {ciHHV}-6 in cellular patient samples by precisely determining the ratio of {HHV}-6 to cellular {DNA}. We validated the assay on confirmed {ciHHV}-6 patient samples and a cell line derived from a {ciHHV}-6 patient, and we analyzed hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients suspected of having {ciHHV}-6. We additionally evaluated whether the assay could be applied to stored plasma samples from a study of clinical correlates of {HHV}-6.{RESULTS}: The {ddPCR} assay accurately identified {ciHHV}-6 in cellular samples (buffy coat, peripheral blood mononuclear cells), giving a ratio very close to 1 {HHV}-6/cell [mean ({SD}), 1.02 (0.03)] in fluorescence in situ hybridization-confirmed samples). In stored plasma samples, the assay performance was set by design to have 100\% sensitivity, which resulted in 82\% specificity for {ciHHV}-6.{CONCLUSIONS}: The possibility of {ciHHV}-6 is often overlooked in patients with detectable {HHV}-6 viral loads by quantitative {PCR}. Our {ddPCR} test provides rapid and accurate laboratory identification of {ciHHV}-6 from easily obtained cellular samples. In addition, the assay provides excellent sensitivity and specificity using stored plasma samples, facilitating retrospective analysis of the clinical significance of {ciHHV}-6.},

  Abstract                 = {Quantitative bioanalytical measurements are commonly performed in a kinetic format and are known to not be robust to perturbation that affects the kinetics itself or the measurement of kinetics. We hypothesized that the same measurements performed in a edigitale (single-molecule) format would show increased robustness to such perturbations. Here, we investigated the robustness of an amplification reaction (reverse-transcription loop-mediated amplification, RT-LAMP) in the context of fluctuations in temperature and time when this reaction is used for quantitative measurements of HIV-1 RNA molecules under limited-resource settings (LRS). The digital format that counts molecules using dRT-LAMP chemistry detected a 2-fold change in concentration of HIV-1 RNA despite a 6 eC temperature variation (p-value = 6.7 e 10e7), whereas the traditional kinetic (real-time) format did not (p-value = 0.25). Digital analysis was also robust to a 20 min change in reaction time, to poor imaging conditions obtained with a consumer cell-phone camera, and to automated cloud-based processing of these images (R2 = 0.9997 vs true counts over a 100-fold dynamic range). Fluorescent output of multiplexed PCR amplification could also be imaged with the cell phone camera using flash as the excitation source. Many nonlinear amplification schemes based on organic, inorganic, and biochemical reactions have been developed, but their robustness is not well understood. This work implies that these chemistries may be significantly more robust in the digital, rather than kinetic, format. It also calls for theoretical studies to predict robustness of these chemistries and, more generally, to design robust reaction architectures. The SlipChip that we used here and other digital microfluidic technologies already exist to enable testing of these predictions. Such work may lead to identification or creation of robust amplification chemistries that enable rapid and precise quantitative molecular measurements under LRS. Furthermore, it may provide more general principles describing robustness of chemical and biological networks in digital formats.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, digital quantitative detection of nucleic acids was achieved at the single-molecule level by chemical initiation of over one thousand sequence-specific, nanoliter isothermal amplification reactions in parallel. Digital polymerase chain reaction (digital {PCR}), a method used for quantification of nucleic acids, counts the presence or absence of amplification of individual molecules. However, it still requires temperature cycling, which is undesirable under resource-limited conditions. This makes isothermal methods for nucleic acid amplification, such as recombinase polymerase amplification ({RPA}), more attractive. A microfluidic digital {RPA} {SlipChip} is described here for simultaneous initiation of over one thousand {nL}-scale {RPA} reactions by adding a chemical initiator to each reaction compartment with a simple slipping step after instrument-free pipet loading. Two designs of the {SlipChip}, two-step slipping and one-step slipping, were validated using digital {RPA}. By using the digital {RPA} {SlipChip}, false-positive results from preinitiation of the {RPA} amplification reaction before incubation were eliminated. End point fluorescence readout was used for "yes or no" digital quantification. The performance of digital {RPA} in a {SlipChip} was validated by amplifying and counting single molecules of the target nucleic acid, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ({MRSA}) genomic {DNA}. The digital {RPA} on {SlipChip} was also tolerant to fluctuations of the incubation temperature (37-42 °C), and its performance was comparable to digital {PCR} on the same {SlipChip} design. The digital {RPA} {SlipChip} provides a simple method to quantify nucleic acids without requiring thermal cycling or kinetic measurements, with potential applications in diagnostics and environmental monitoring under resource-limited settings. The ability to initiate thousands of chemical reactions in parallel on the nanoliter scale using solvent-resistant glass devices is likely to be useful for a broader range of applications.},

The fluidic path for introducing the sample combined with the {PCR} mixture was formed using elongated wells in the two plates of the {SlipChip} designed to overlap during sample loading. This fluidic path was broken up by simple slipping of the two plates that removed the overlap among wells and brought each well in contact with a reservoir preloaded with oil to generate 1280 reaction compartments (2.6 {nL} each) simultaneously. After thermal cycling, end-point fluorescence intensity was used to detect the presence of nucleic acid. Digital {PCR} on the {SlipChip} was tested quantitatively by using Staphylococcus aureus genomic {DNA}. As the concentration of the template {DNA} in the reaction mixture was diluted, the fraction of positive wells decreased as expected from the statistical analysis. No cross-contamination was observed during the experiments. At the extremes of the dynamic range of digital {PCR} the standard confidence interval determined using a normal approximation of the binomial distribution is not satisfactory. Therefore, statistical analysis based on the score method was used to establish these confidence intervals. The {SlipChip} provides a simple strategy to count nucleic acids by using {PCR}. It may find applications in research applications such as single cell analysis, prenatal diagnostics, and point-of-care diagnostics. {SlipChip} would become valuable for diagnostics, including applications in resource-limited areas after integration with isothermal nucleic acid amplification technologies and visual readout.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we are working toward a problem of great importance to global health: determination of viral {HIV} and hepatitis C ({HCV}) loads under point-of-care and resource limited settings. While antiretroviral treatments are becoming widely available, viral load must be evaluated at regular intervals to prevent the spread of drug resistance and requires a quantitative measurement of {RNA} concentration over a wide dynamic range (from 50 up to 10(6) molecules/{mL} for {HIV} and up to 10(8) molecules/{mL} for {HCV}). "Digital" single molecule measurements are attractive for quantification, but the dynamic range of such systems is typically limited or requires excessive numbers of compartments. Here we designed and tested two microfluidic rotational {SlipChips} to perform multivolume digital {RT}-{PCR} ({MV} digital {RT}-{PCR}) experiments with large and tunable dynamic range. These designs were characterized using synthetic control {RNA} and validated with {HIV} viral {RNA} and {HCV} control viral {RNA}. The first design contained 160 wells of each of four volumes (125 {nL}, 25 {nL}, 5 {nL}, and 1 {nL}) to achieve a dynamic range of 5.2 × 10(2) to 4.0 × 10(6) molecules/{mL} at 3-fold resolution. The second design tested the flexibility of this approach, and further expanded it to allow for multiplexing while maintaining a large dynamic range by adding additional wells with volumes of 0.2 {nL} and 625 {nL} and dividing the {SlipChip} into five regions to analyze five samples each at a dynamic range of 1.8 × 10(3) to 1.2 × 10(7) molecules/{mL} at 3-fold resolution. No evidence of cross-contamination was observed. The multiplexed {SlipChip} can be used to analyze a single sample at a dynamic range of 1.7 × 10(2) to 2.0 × 10(7) molecules/{mL} at 3-fold resolution with limit of detection of 40 molecules/{mL}. {HIV} viral {RNA} purified from clinical samples were tested on the {SlipChip}, and viral load results were self-consistent and in good agreement with results determined using the Roche {COBAS} {AmpliPrep}/{COBAS} {TaqMan} {HIV}-1 Test. With further validation, this {SlipChip} should become useful to precisely quantify viral {HIV} and {HCV} {RNA} for high-performance diagnostics in resource-limited settings. These microfluidic designs should also be valuable for other diagnostic and research applications, including detecting rare cells and rare mutations, prenatal diagnostics, monitoring residual disease, and quantifying copy number variation and gene expression patterns. The theory for the design and analysis of multivolume digital {PCR} experiments is presented in other work by Kreutz et al.},

  Abstract                 = {{RNA} sequencing ({RNA}-Seq) is a powerful tool for transcriptome profiling, but is hampered by sequence-dependent bias and inaccuracy at low copy numbers intrinsic to exponential {PCR} amplification. We developed a simple strategy for mitigating these complications, allowing truly digital {RNA}-Seq. Following reverse transcription, a large set of barcode sequences is added in excess, and nearly every {cDNA} molecule is uniquely labeled by random attachment of barcode sequences to both ends. After {PCR}, we applied paired-end deep sequencing to read the two barcodes and {cDNA} sequences. Rather than counting the number of reads, {RNA} abundance is measured based on the number of unique barcode sequences observed for a given {cDNA} sequence. We optimized the barcodes to be unambiguously identifiable, even in the presence of multiple sequencing errors. This method allows counting with single-copy resolution despite sequence-dependent bias and {PCR}-amplification noise, and is analogous to digital {PCR} but amendable to quantifying a whole transcriptome. We demonstrated transcriptome profiling of Escherichia coli with more accurate and reproducible quantification than conventional {RNA}-Seq.},

We use this technique in our healthy study population to determine the overall concentration of the t(14;18) translocation, which is strongly associated with follicular lymphoma. The nested {dPCR} approach improves the detection limit to 1×10(-7) or lower while maintaining the analysis efficiency and specificity. Further, the bead-based {dPCR} enabled us to isolate and quantify the relative amounts of the various clonal forms of t(14;18) translocation in these subjects, and the single-molecule sensitivity and resolution of {dPCR} led to the discovery of new clonal forms of t(14;18) that were otherwise masked by the conventional quantitative {PCR} measurements. In this manner, we created a quantitative map for this carcinogenic mutation in this healthy population and identified the positions on chromosomes 14 and 18 where the vast majority of these t(14;18) events occur.},

  Abstract                 = {{AIM}: A digital {PCR} approach has recently been suggested to detect greater amounts of cell-free fetal {DNA} in maternal plasma than conventional real-time quantitative {PCR} ({qPCR}). Because the digital {qPCR} approach uses shorter {PCR} amplicons than the real-time {qPCR} assay, we investigated whether a real-time {qPCR} assay appropriately modified for such short amplicons would improve the detection of cell-free fetal {DNA}.
{METHOD}: We developed a novel universal-template ({UT}) real-time {qPCR} assay that was specific for the {DYS}14 sequence on Y chromosome and had a short amplicon size of 50 bp. We examined this "short" assay with 50 maternal plasma samples and compared the results with those for a conventional real-time {qPCR} assay of the same locus but with a longer amplicon (84 bp).
{RESULTS}: Qualitatively, both assays detected male cell-free fetal {DNA} with the same specificity and detection capability. Quantitatively, however, the new {UT} real-time {qPCR} assay for shorter amplicons detected, on average, almost 1.6-fold more cell-free fetal {DNA} than the conventional real-time {qPCR} assay with longer amplicons.
{CONCLUSIONS}: The use of short {PCR} amplicons improves the detection of cell-free fetal {DNA}. This feature may prove useful in attempts to detect cell-free fetal {DNA} under conditions in which the amount of template is low, such as in samples obtained early in pregnancy.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Quantification cycle (Cq) and amplification efficiency (AE) are parameters mathematically extracted from raw data to characterize quantitative PCR (qPCR) reactions and quantify the copy number in a sample. Little attention has been paid to the effects of preprocessing and the use of smoothing or filtering approaches to compensate for noisy data. Existing algorithms largely are taken for granted, and it is unclear which of the various methods is most informative. We investigated the effect of smoothing and filtering algorithms on amplification curve data.
METHODS: We obtained published high-replicate qPCR data sets from standard block thermocyclers and other cycler platforms and statistically evaluated the impact of smoothing on Cq and AE.
RESULTS: Our results indicate that selected smoothing algorithms affect estimates of Cq and AE considerably. The commonly used moving average filter performed worst in all qPCR scenarios. The SavitzkyeGolay smoother, cubic splines, and Whittaker smoother resulted overall in the least bias in our setting and exhibited low sensitivity to differences in qPCR AE, whereas other smoothers, such as running mean, introduced an AE-dependent bias.
CONCLUSIONS: The selection of a smoothing algorithm is an important step in developing data analysis pipelines for real-time PCR experiments. We offer guidelines for selection of an appropriate smoothing algorithm in diagnostic qPCR applications. The findings of our study were implemented in the R packages chipPCR and qpcR as a basis for the implementation of an analytical strategy.},

  Abstract                 = {Deoxyribonucleic acid ({DNA}) of the human immunodeficiency virus ({HIV}) provides the most sensitive measurement of residual infection in patients on effective combination antiretroviral therapy ({cART}). Droplet digital {PCR} ({ddPCR}) has recently been shown to provide highly accurate quantification of {DNA} copy number, but its application to quantification of {HIV} {DNA}, or other equally rare targets, has not been reported. This paper demonstrates and analyzes the application of {ddPCR} to measure the frequency of total {HIV} {DNA} (pol copies per million cells), and episomal 2-{LTR} (long terminal repeat) circles in cells isolated from infected patients. Analysis of over 300 clinical samples, including over 150 clinical samples assayed in triplicate by {ddPCR} and by real-time {PCR} ({qPCR}), demonstrates a significant increase in precision, with an average 5-fold decrease in the coefficient of variation of pol copy numbers and a {\textgreater}20-fold accuracy improvement for 2-{LTR} circles. Additional benefits of the {ddPCR} assay over {qPCR} include absolute quantification without reliance on an external standard and relative insensitivity to mismatches in primer and probe sequences. These features make digital {PCR} an attractive alternative for measurement of {HIV} {DNA} in clinical specimens. The improved sensitivity and precision of measurement of these rare events should facilitate measurements to characterize the latent {HIV} reservoir and interventions to eradicate it.},

This review summarizes recent advances that may lead to clinically useful tests with improved sensitivity, reproducibility and throughput.
{RECENT} {FINDINGS}: {HIV} {DNA} remains the most sensitive measure of residual infection, but its low levels are difficult to differentiate from assay noise by {qPCR}. Digital {PCR} has begun to improve the precision of existing real-time assays, but there remains a need to distinguish replication-competent proviruses. Rapid technological progress in single-cell analysis is beginning to offer new approaches, notably {CyTOF} and microengraving, which could provide vastly more information about the composition of the latent reservoir.
{SUMMARY}: To investigate and assess therapies directed towards eradication, improved assays that simultaneously offer high sensitivity, precision and information content will be needed.},

Furthermore, picodroplet {dPCR} facilitates simultaneous screening for multiple mutations from the same sample.
{METHODS}: We investigated the utility of multiplex {dPCR} to screen for the 7 most common mutations in codons 12 and 13 of the {KRAS} (Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog) oncogene from plasma samples of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. Fifty plasma samples were tested from patients for whom the primary tumor biopsy tissue {DNA} had been characterized by quantitative {PCR}.
{RESULTS}: Tumor characterization revealed that 19 patient tumors had {KRAS} mutations. Multiplex {dPCR} analysis of the plasma {DNA} prepared from these samples identified 14 samples that matched the mutation identified in the tumor, 1 sample contained a different {KRAS} mutation, and 4 samples had no detectable mutation. Among the tumor samples that were wild type for {KRAS}, 2 {KRAS} mutations were identified in the corresponding plasma samples. Duplex {dPCR} (i.e., wild-type and single-mutation assay) was also used to analyze plasma samples from patients with {KRAS}-mutated tumors and 5 samples expected to contain the {BRAF} (v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B) V600E mutation. The results for the duplex analysis matched those for the multiplex analysis for {KRAS}-mutated samples and, owing to its higher sensitivity, enabled detection of 2 additional samples with low levels of {KRAS}-mutated {DNA}. All 5 samples with {BRAF} mutations were detected.
{CONCLUSIONS}: This work demonstrates the clinical utility of multiplex {dPCR} to screen for multiple mutations simultaneously with a sensitivity sufficient to detect mutations in circulating {DNA} obtained by noninvasive blood collection.},

  Abstract                 = {The problem of identifying differential activity such as in gene expression is a major defeat in biostatistics and bioinformatics. Equally important, however much less frequently studied, is the question of similar activity from one biological condition to another. The fold-change, or ratio, is usually considered a relevant criterion for stating difference and similarity between measurements. Importantly, no statistical method for concomitant evaluation of similarity and distinctness currently exists for biological applications. Modern microarray, digital {PCR} ({dPCR}), and Next-Generation Sequencing ({NGS}) technologies frequently provide a means of coefficient of variation estimation for individual measurements. Using fold-change, and by making the assumption that measurements are normally distributed with known variances, we designed a novel statistical test that allows us to detect concomitantly, thus using the same formalism, differentially and similarly expressed genes (http://cds.ihes.fr). Given two sets of gene measurements in different biological conditions, the probabilities of making type I and type {II} errors in stating that a gene is differentially or similarly expressed from one condition to the other can be calculated. Furthermore, a confidence interval for the fold-change can be delineated. Finally, we demonstrate that the assumption of normality can be relaxed to consider arbitrary distributions numerically. The Concomitant evaluation of Distinctness and Similarity ({CDS}) statistical test correctly estimates similarities and differences between measurements of gene expression. The implementation, being time and memory efficient, allows the use of the {CDS} test in high-throughput data analysis such as microarray, {dPCR}, and {NGS} experiments. Importantly, the {CDS} test can be applied to the comparison of single measurements (N=1) provided the variance (or coefficient of variation) of the signals is known, making {CDS} a valuable tool also in biomedical analysis where typically a single measurement per subject is available.},

  Abstract                 = {{BACKGROUND}: The putative promoter of the holocarboxylase synthetase ({HLCS}) gene on chromosome 21 is hypermethylated in placental tissues and could be detected as a fetal-specific {DNA} marker in maternal plasma. Detection of fetal trisomy 21 (T21) has been demonstrated by an epigenetic-genetic chromosome dosage approach where the amount of hypermethylated {HLCS} in maternal plasma is normalized using a fetal genetic marker on the Y chromosome as a chromosome dosage reference marker. We explore if this method can be applied on both male and female fetuses with the use of a paternally-inherited fetal single nucleotide polymorphism ({SNP}) allele on a reference chromosome for chromosome dosage normalization.
{METHODOLOGY}: We quantified hypermethylated {HLCS} molecules using methylation-sensitive restriction endonuclease digestion followed by real-time or digital {PCR} analyses. For chromosome dosage analysis, we compared the amount of digestion-resistant {HLCS} to that of a {SNP} allele (rs6636, a C/G {SNP}) that the fetus has inherited from the father but absent in the pregnant mother.
{PRINCIPAL} {FINDINGS}: Using a fetal-specific {SNP} allele on a reference chromosome, we analyzed 20 euploid and nine T21 placental tissue samples. All samples with the fetal-specific C allele were correctly classified. One sample from each of the euploid and T21 groups were misclassified when the fetal-specific G allele was used as the reference marker. We then analyzed 33 euploid and 14 T21 maternal plasma samples. All but one sample from each of the euploid and T21 groups were correctly classified using the fetal-specific C allele, while correct classification was achieved for all samples using the fetal-specific G allele as the reference marker.
{CONCLUSIONS}: As a proof-of-concept study, we have demonstrated that the epigenetic-genetic chromosome dosage approach can be applied to the prenatal diagnosis of trisomy 21 for both male and female fetuses.},

  Abstract                 = {{BACKGROUND}: The use of fetal {DNA} in maternal plasma for noninvasive prenatal diagnosis of trisomy 21 (T21) is an actively researched area. We propose a novel method of T21 detection that combines fetal-specific epigenetic and genetic markers.
{METHODS}: We used combined bisulfite restriction analysis to search for fetal {DNA} markers on chromosome 21 that were differentially methylated in the placenta and maternal blood cells and confirmed any target locus with bisulfite sequencing. We then used methylation-sensitive restriction endonuclease digestion followed by microfluidics digital {PCR} analysis to investigate the identified marker. Chromosome-dosage analysis was performed by comparing the dosage of this epigenetic marker with that of the {ZFY} (zinc finger protein, Y-linked) gene on chromosome Y.
{RESULTS}: The putative promoter of the {HLCS} (holocarboxylase synthetase) gene was hypermethylated in the placenta and hypomethylated in maternal blood cells. A chromosome-dosage comparison of the hypermethylated {HLCS} and {ZFY} loci could distinguish samples of T21 and euploid placental {DNA}. Twenty-four maternal plasma samples from euploid pregnancies and 5 maternal plasma samples from T21 pregnancies were analyzed. All but 1 of the euploid samples were correctly classified.
{CONCLUSIONS}: The epigenetic-genetic chromosome-dosage approach is a new method for noninvasive prenatal detection of T21. The epigenetic part of the analysis can be applied to all pregnancies. Because the genetic part of the analysis uses paternally inherited, fetal-specific genetic markers that are abundant in the genome, broad population coverage should be readily achievable. This approach has the potential to become a generally usable technique for noninvasive prenatal diagnosis.},

  Abstract                 = {{BACKGROUND}: Maternal plasma {mRNA} encoded by the {PLAC}4 gene (placenta-specific 4), which is transcribed from chromosome 21 in placental cells, is a potential marker for the noninvasive assessment of chromosome 21 dosage in the fetus. We evaluated the diagnostic sensitivities and specificities of 2 trisomy 21-screening approaches that use maternal plasma {PLAC}4 {mRNA}.
{METHODS}: We studied maternal plasma samples from 153 pregnant women carrying euploid and trisomy 21 fetuses. For the samples in which the fetuses were heterozygous for the studied {PLAC}4 single-nucleotide polymorphism ({SNP}), we measured the ratio between 2 alleles of the {SNP} in maternal plasma {PLAC}4 {mRNA} ({RNA}-{SNP}) by mass spectrometric ({MS}) and digital {PCR} methods. For pregnancies involving fetuses homozygous for the {SNP}, we quantified the total {PLAC}4 {mRNA} concentration in maternal plasma by real-time {PCR} and digital {PCR}.
{RESULTS}: For the {RNA}-{SNP} approach, we achieved a diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of 100\% (95\% {CI}, 40.2\%-100\%) and 89.7\% (95\% {CI}, 78.8\%-96.1\%), respectively, for both the {MS} and the digital {PCR} methods. For the {mRNA}-quantification approach, the areas under the {ROC} curves were 0.859 (95\% {CI}, 0.741-0.903) and 0.833 (95\% {CI}, 0.770-0.923) for plasma {PLAC}4 {mRNA} concentrations measured by the real-time {PCR} and the digital {PCR} methods, respectively.
{CONCLUSIONS}: For prenatal screening of trisomy 21, the quantification of the total {PLAC}4 {mRNA} concentration can be used in a synergistic manner with the {RNA}-{SNP} allelic ratio approach to increase the population coverage of cases in which diagnostic information can be obtained.},

  Abstract                 = {Hemophilia is a bleeding disorder with X-linked inheritance. Current prenatal diagnostic methods for hemophilia are invasive and pose a risk to the fetus. Cell-free fetal {DNA} analysis in maternal plasma provides a noninvasive mean of assessing fetal sex in such pregnancies. However, the disease status of male fetuses remains unknown if mutation-specific confirmatory analysis is not performed. Here we have developed a noninvasive test to diagnose whether the fetus has inherited a causative mutation for hemophilia from its mother. The strategy is based on a relative mutation dosage approach, which we have previously established for determining the mutational status of fetuses for autosomal disease mutations. In this study, the relative mutation dosage method is used to deduce whether a fetus has inherited a hemophilia mutation on chromosome X by detecting whether the concentration of the mutant or wild-type allele is overrepresented in the plasma of heterozygous women carrying male fetuses. We correctly detected fetal genotypes for hemophilia mutations in all of the 12 studied maternal plasma samples obtained from at-risk pregnancies from as early as the 11th week of gestation. This development would make the decision to undertake prenatal testing less traumatic and safer for at-risk families.},

The fact that circulating fetal {DNA} represents only a minor fraction of the {DNA} that is present in maternal plasma has presented analytical challenges for a number of applications. In this review, we discuss such challenges and how they have been resolved by recent developments in the field.
{RECENT} {FINDINGS}: Digital molecular counting methods, such as digital {PCR} and massively parallel sequencing, have enabled high quantitative precision for maternal plasma {DNA} analysis. Noninvasive prenatal analysis of monogenic disease mutations has been achieved by identifying small quantitative differences between the mutant and wild-type alleles in maternal plasma. By measuring the small increment in the fractional concentrations of {DNA} derived from potentially aneuploid chromosomes in maternal plasma, fetal chromosomal aneuploidies have been detected with high diagnostic accuracies.
{SUMMARY}: Recently, advances in molecular technologies have enhanced the diagnostic applications of maternal plasma {DNA} analysis for noninvasive prenatal diagnosis. We foresee that this technology could play an increasingly important role in prenatal investigations.},

The most common clinical applications, i.e. prenatal gender determination and fetal {RhD} genotyping, are possible already in the first trimester using specialized protocols for {DNA} isolation from plasma and subsequent real-time {PCR} detection. Recent advances in molecular techniques enable other applications of fetal {DNA} purified from maternal plasma samples. Chromosomal abnormalities (e.g. trisomy 21) can be diagnosed by digital {PCR}, which offers higher accuracy in quantifying {DNA} sequences than standard real-time {PCR}. Digital {PCR}, but also {MALDI}-{TOF}, are suitable for detecting point mutations, widening the spectrum of applications to monogenic diseases. The ongoing lowering of costs for massively parallel sequencing might lead to replacement of most of the other currently used approaches. Adopting specialized protocols for the purification of fragmented circulating fetal {DNA} and improving the bioinformatic analysis of raw data can bring us closer to sequencing the fetal genome as the ultimate goal of prenatal {DNA} diagnostics, with wide-ranging medical applications. The discussion and solution of ethical issues beyond early fetal gender or paternity determination is hanging just behind the rapid technical progress of noninvasive prenatal {DNA} diagnostics.},

  Abstract                 = {The existence of cell free {DNA} in the human circulatory system has been known since the 1950s, however, intensive research in this area has been conducted for the last ten years. This review paper brings a short overview of the existing literature concerning the cell free {DNA} research in various clinical fields and pathological states and considers the application possibilities of this new analyte in clinical laboratory diagnostics. At the moment, cell free {DNA} is most widely used for the purpose of non-invasive prenatal diagnosis of fetal sex or fetal {RhD} status. The recent discovery of epigenetic changes in placental/fetal {DNA} and the detection of fetal/placental-specific {RNAs} have made it possible to use this technology in all pregnancies irrespective of the gender of the fetus. With the application of new techniques such as next generation sequencing, digital {PCR} and mass spectrometry, it is now possible to detect very small amounts of specific {DNA} in the presence of excess of other nonspecific nucleic acids. Second most probable application is in oncology, where detection and monitoring of tumors is now possible by the detection of tumor-derived nucleic acids. Third promising field for near future implementation of this analyte is transplantation medicine, where free {DNA} level could serve as a marker of transplant rejection. Before any further utilization of this new biomarker, pre-analytical and analytical aspects of free {DNA} analysis remain to be standardized. In the field of noninvasive prenatal diagnosis, important ethical, legal and social questions remain to be discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {{BACKGROUND}: The {EGFR} [epidermal growth factor receptor (erythroblastic leukemia viral (v-erb-b) oncogene homolog, avian)] gene is known to harbor genomic alterations in advanced lung cancer involving gene amplification and kinase mutations that predict the clinical response to {EGFR}-targeted inhibitors. Methods for detecting such molecular changes in lung cancer tumors are desirable.
{METHODS}: We used a nanofluidic digital {PCR} array platform and 16 cell lines and 20 samples of genomic {DNA} from resected tumors (stages I-{III}) to quantify the relative numbers of copies of the {EGFR} gene and to detect mutated {EGFR} alleles in lung cancer. We assessed the relative number of {EGFR} gene copies by calculating the ratio of the number of {EGFR} molecules (measured with a 6-carboxyfluorescein-labeled Scorpion assay) to the number of molecules of the single-copy gene {RPP}30 (ribonuclease P/{MRP} 30kDa subunit) (measured with a 6-carboxy-X-rhodamine-labeled {TaqMan} assay) in each panel. To assay for the {EGFR} L858R (exon 21) mutation and exon 19 in-frame deletions, we used the {ARMS} and Scorpion technologies in a {DxS}/Qiagen {EGFR}29 Mutation Test Kit for the digital {PCR} array.
{RESULTS}: The digital array detected and quantified rare gefitinib/erlotinib-sensitizing {EGFR} mutations (0.02\%-9.26\% abundance) that were present in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples of early-stage resectable lung tumors without an associated increase in gene copy number. Our results also demonstrated the presence of intratumor molecular heterogeneity for the clinically relevant {EGFR} mutated alleles in these early-stage lung tumors.
{CONCLUSIONS}: The digital {PCR} array platform allows characterization and quantification of oncogenes, such as {EGFR}, at the single-molecule level. Use of this nanofluidics platform may provide deeper insight into the specific roles of clinically relevant kinase mutations during different stages of lung tumor progression and may be useful in predicting the clinical response to {EGFR}-targeted inhibitors.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper assesses the quantitative resolution of {qPCR} using copy number variation ({CNV}) as a paradigm. An error model is developed for real-time {qPCR} data showing how the precision of {CNV} determination varies with the number of replicates. Using samples with varying numbers of X chromosomes, experimental data demonstrates that real-time {qPCR} can readily distinguish four copes from five copies, which corresponds to a 1.25-fold difference in relative quantity. Digital {PCR} is considered as an alternative form of {qPCR}. For digital {PCR}, an error model is shown that relates the precision of {CNV} determination to the number of reaction chambers. The quantitative capability of digital {PCR} is illustrated with an experiment distinguishing four and five copies of the human gene {MRGPRX}1. For either real-time {qPCR} or digital {PCR}, practical application of these models to achieve enhanced quantitative resolution requires use of a high throughput {PCR} platform that can simultaneously perform thousands of reactions. Comparing the two methods, real-time {qPCR} has the advantage of throughput and digital {PCR} has the advantage of simplicity in terms of the assumptions made for data analysis.},

Although assays utilizing {PCR} amplification of bisulfite-converted {DNA} are widely employed to analyze these {DNA} methylation alterations, they are generally limited in throughput capacity, detection sensitivity, and or resolution. Digital {PCR}, in which a {DNA} sample is analyzed in distributive fashion over multiple reaction chambers, allows for enumeration of discrete template {DNA} molecules, as well as sequestration of non-specific primer annealing templates into negative chambers, thereby increasing the signal-to-noise ratio in positive chambers. Here, we have applied digital {PCR} technology to bisulfite-converted {DNA} for single-molecule high-resolution {DNA} methylation analysis and for increased sensitivity {DNA} methylation detection. We developed digital bisulfite genomic {DNA} sequencing to efficiently determine single-basepair {DNA} methylation patterns on single-molecule {DNA} templates without an interim cloning step. We also developed digital {MethyLight}, which surpasses traditional {MethyLight} in detection sensitivity and quantitative accuracy for low quantities of {DNA}.

  Abstract                 = {Digital {PCR} ({dPCR}) is a highly accurate molecular approach, capable of precise measurements, offering a number of unique opportunities. However, in its current format {dPCR} can be limited by the amount of sample that can be analysed and consequently additional considerations such as performing multiplex reactions or pre-amplification can be considered. This study investigated the impact of duplexing and pre-amplification on {dPCR} analysis by using three different assays targeting a model template (a portion of the Arabidopsis thaliana alcohol dehydrogenase gene). We also investigated the impact of different template types (linearised plasmid clone and more complex genomic {DNA}) on measurement precision using {dPCR}. We were able to demonstrate that duplex {dPCR} can provide a more precise measurement than uniplex {dPCR}, while applying pre-amplification or varying template type can significantly decrease the precision of {dPCR}. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that the pre-amplification step can introduce measurement bias that is not consistent between experiments for a sample or assay and so could not be compensated for during the analysis of this data set. We also describe a model for estimating the prevalence of molecular dropout and identify this as a source of {dPCR} imprecision. Our data have demonstrated that the precision afforded by {dPCR} at low sample concentration can exceed that of the same template post pre-amplification thereby negating the need for this additional step. Our findings also highlight the technical differences between different templates types containing the same sequence that must be considered if plasmid {DNA} is to be used to assess or control for more complex templates like genomic {DNA}.},

  Abstract                 = {One of the benefits of Digital {PCR} ({dPCR}) is the potential for unparalleled precision enabling smaller fold change measurements. An example of an assessment that could benefit from such improved precision is the measurement of tumour-associated copy number variation ({CNV}) in the cell free {DNA} ({cfDNA}) fraction of patient blood plasma. To investigate the potential precision of {dPCR} and compare it with the established technique of quantitative {PCR} ({qPCR}), we used breast cancer cell lines to investigate {HER}2 gene amplification and modelled a range of different {CNVs}. We showed that, with equal experimental replication, {dPCR} could measure a smaller {CNV} than {qPCR}. As {dPCR} precision is directly dependent upon both the number of replicate measurements and the template concentration, we also developed a method to assist the design of {dPCR} experiments for measuring {CNV}. Using an existing model (based on Poisson and binomial distributions) to derive an expression for the variance inherent in {dPCR}, we produced a power calculation to define the experimental size required to reliably detect a given fold change at a given template concentration. This work will facilitate any future translation of {dPCR} to key diagnostic applications, such as cancer diagnostics and analysis of {cfDNA}.},

  Abstract                 = {{BACKGROUND}: Next-generation {DNA} sequencing on the 454, Solexa, and {SOLiD} platforms requires absolute calibration of the number of molecules to be sequenced. This requirement has two unfavorable consequences. First, large amounts of sample-typically micrograms-are needed for library preparation, thereby limiting the scope of samples which can be sequenced. For many applications, including metagenomics and the sequencing of ancient, forensic, and clinical samples, the quantity of input {DNA} can be critically limiting. Second, each library requires a titration sequencing run, thereby increasing the cost and lowering the throughput of sequencing.
{RESULTS}: We demonstrate the use of digital {PCR} to accurately quantify 454 and Solexa sequencing libraries, enabling the preparation of sequencing libraries from nanogram quantities of input material while eliminating costly and time-consuming titration runs of the sequencer. We successfully sequenced low-nanogram scale bacterial and mammalian {DNA} samples on the 454 {FLX} and Solexa {DNA} sequencing platforms. This study is the first to definitively demonstrate the successful sequencing of picogram quantities of input {DNA} on the 454 platform, reducing the sample requirement more than 1000-fold without pre-amplification and the associated bias and reduction in library depth.
{CONCLUSION}: The digital {PCR} assay allows absolute quantification of sequencing libraries, eliminates uncertainties associated with the construction and application of standard curves to {PCR}-based quantification, and with a coefficient of variation close to 10\%, is sufficiently precise to enable direct sequencing without titration runs.},

We have sought to challenge the limits of this technique with regards to quality and quantity of starting material and the depth of sequencing required. We confirm that the technique can be used to interrogate {DNA} from cell lines, fresh frozen material and {FFPE} samples to assess copy number variation. We show that as little as 5 ng of {DNA} is needed to generate a copy number karyogram, and follow this up with data from a series of {FFPE} biopsies and surgical samples. We have used various levels of sample multiplexing to demonstrate the adjustable resolution of the methodology, depending on the number of samples and available resources. We also demonstrate reproducibility by use of replicate samples and comparison with microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization ({aCGH}) and digital {PCR}.

  Abstract                 = {While the bulk of the finished microbial genomes sequenced to date are derived from cultured bacterial and archaeal representatives, the vast majority of microorganisms elude current culturing attempts, severely limiting the ability to recover complete or even partial genomes from these environmental species. Single cell genomics is a novel culture-independent approach, which enables access to the genetic material of an individual cell. No single cell genome has to our knowledge been closed and finished to date. Here we report the completed genome from an uncultured single cell of Candidatus Sulcia muelleri {DMIN}. Digital {PCR} on single symbiont cells isolated from the bacteriome of the green sharpshooter Draeculacephala minerva bacteriome allowed us to assess that this bacteria is polyploid with genome copies ranging from approximately 200-900 per cell, making it a most suitable target for single cell finishing efforts. For single cell shotgun sequencing, an individual Sulcia cell was isolated and whole genome amplified by multiple displacement amplification ({MDA}). Sanger-based finishing methods allowed us to close the genome. To verify the correctness of our single cell genome and exclude {MDA}-derived artifacts, we independently shotgun sequenced and assembled the Sulcia genome from pooled bacteriomes using a metagenomic approach, yielding a nearly identical genome. Four variations we detected appear to be genuine biological differences between the two samples. Comparison of the single cell genome with bacteriome metagenomic sequence data detected two single nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNPs}), indicating extremely low genetic diversity within a Sulcia population. This study demonstrates the power of single cell genomics to generate a complete, high quality, non-composite reference genome within an environmental sample, which can be used for population genetic analyzes.},

  Abstract                 = {{PURPOSE}: We aim to develop a digital {PCR}-based method for the quantitative detection of the two common epidermal growth factor receptor ({EGFR}) mutations (in-frame deletion at exon 19 and L858R at exon 21) in the plasma and tumor tissues of patients suffering from non-small cell lung cancers. These two mutations account for {\textgreater}85\% of clinically important {EGFR} mutations associated with responsiveness to tyrosine kinase inhibitors.
{EXPERIMENTAL} {DESIGN}: {DNA} samples were analyzed using a microfluidics system that simultaneously performed 9,180 {PCRs} at nanoliter scale. A single-mutant {DNA} molecule in a clinical specimen could be detected and the quantities of mutant and wild-type sequences were precisely determined.
{RESULTS}: Exon 19 deletion and L858R mutation were detectable in 6 (17\%) and 9 (26\%) of 35 pretreatment plasma samples, respectively. When compared with the sequencing results of the tumor samples, the sensitivity and specificity of plasma {EGFR} mutation analysis were 92\% and 100\%, respectively. The plasma concentration of the mutant sequences correlated well with the clinical response. Decreased concentration was observed in all patients with partial or complete clinical remission, whereas persistence of mutation was observed in a patient with cancer progression. In one patient, tyrosine kinase inhibitor was stopped after an initial response and the tumor-associated {EGFR} mutation reemerged 4 weeks after stopping treatment.
{CONCLUSION}: The sensitive detection and accurate quantification of low abundance {EGFR} mutations in tumor tissues and plasma by microfluidics digital {PCR} would be useful for predicting treatment response, monitoring disease progression and early detection of treatment failure associated with acquired drug resistance.},

In contrast to valve-actuated devices that only modulate the flow of the dispersed phase being continuously injected, this integrated micropump allows the combination of fluidic transport and modulation to achieve active control of droplet generation. A distinct characteristic of this method compared to the valve modulated droplet formation processes is that it enables independent control of droplet generation frequency by adjusting the pumping frequency and droplet size by flow conditions. We also demonstrated the generation of complex droplet patterns through programming the pumping configurations and the application to multi-volume digital {PCR} for precise and quantitative detection of genetic targets. Overall, our results suggest that the pump-based droplet microfluidics provide a robust platform for programmable active droplet generation which could facilitate the development of high-performance chemical and biological assays.},

  Abstract                 = {The genus Parapoxvirus ({PAPV}) is comprised traditionally of orf virus ({ORFV}), pseudocowpox virus ({PCPV}) and bovine papular stomatitis virus ({BPSV}), which cause infections of ruminants and their handlers in the U.S. and worldwide. Unlike orthopoxvirus infections, which can cause systemic or localized infections, {PAPV} infections present normally as benign, self-limited and localized skin lesions; infections do not confer lifelong immunity. In recent years, related potentially to enhanced awareness and the availability of diagnostic methods, there has been an observed increase in reported cases of {PAPV} in animals and humans. This study describes {TaqMan} based real-time {PCR} assays for both generic and specific detection of {PAPV} species for surveillance and outbreak investigations. These assays target highly conserved {PAPV} {RNA} polymerase gene sequences and are capable of detecting three known species of {PAPVs} ({ORFV}, {PCPV}, and {BPSV}). The assays were evaluated using a panel of {PAPV} {DNA} derived from human infections or animal specimen remainders. The sensitivities of all four assays were determined using droplet digital {PCR}; fewer than 10 copies of clinical {PAPV} {DNA} can be detected consistently. These assays provide a reliable and sensitive method for rapid confirmation and characterization {PAPV} infections with varying clinical presentations.},

  Abstract                 = {Quantitative polymerase chain reactions ({qPCR}) based on real-time {PCR} constitute a powerful and sensitive method for the analysis of nucleic acids. However, in {qPCR}, the ability to multiplex targets using differently colored fluorescent probes is typically limited to 4-fold by the spectral overlap of the fluorophores. Furthermore, multiplexing {qPCR} assays requires expensive instrumentation and most often lengthy assay development cycles. Digital {PCR} ({dPCR}), which is based on the amplification of single target {DNA} molecules in many separate reactions, is an attractive alternative to {qPCR}. Here we report a novel and easy method for multiplexing {dPCR} in picolitre droplets within emulsions-generated and read out in microfluidic devices-that takes advantage of both the very high numbers of reactions possible within emulsions ({\textgreater}10(6)) as well as the high likelihood that the amplification of only a single target {DNA} molecule will initiate within each droplet. By varying the concentration of different fluorogenic probes of the same color, it is possible to identify the different probes on the basis of fluorescence intensity. Adding multiple colors increases the number of possible reactions geometrically, rather than linearly as with {qPCR}. Accurate and precise copy numbers of up to sixteen per cell were measured using a model system. A 5-plex assay for spinal muscular atrophy was demonstrated with just two fluorophores to simultaneously measure the copy number of two genes ({SMN}1 and {SMN}2) and to genotype a single nucleotide polymorphism (c.815A{\textgreater}G, {SMN}1). Results of a pilot study with {SMA} patients are presented.},

  Abstract                 = {Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma ({PDAC}) is one of the most malignant cancers with more than 94\% mortality rate mainly due to the widespread metastases. To find out the somatically mutated genes related to the metastasis of {PDAC}, we analyzed the matched tumor and normal tissue samples from a patient diagnosed with liver metastatic {PDAC} using intensive exome capture-sequencing analysis ({\textgreater} 170× coverage). Searching for the somatic mutations that drive the clonal expansion of metastasis, we identified 12 genes with higher allele frequencies ({AFs}) of functional mutations in the metastatic tumor, including known genes {KRAS} and {TP}53 for metastasis. Of the 10 candidate genes, 6 ({ADRB}1, {DCLK}1, {KCNH}2, {NOP}14, {SIGLEC}1, and {ZC}3H7A), together with {KRAS} and {TP}53, were clustered into a single network (p value = 1 × 10(-22)) that is related to cancer development. Moreover, these candidate genes showed abnormal expression in {PDAC} tissues and functional impacts on the migration, proliferation, and colony formation abilities of pancreatic cancer cell lines. Furthermore, through digital {PCR} analysis, we revealed potential genomic mechanisms for the {KRAS} and {TP}53 mutations in the metastatic tumor. Taken together, our study shows the possibility for such personalized genomic profiling to provide new biological insight into the metastasis of {PDAC}.},

In primary tumors, however, the analysis of {LOH} is fraught with technical problems that have limited its reproducibility and interpretation. In particular, tumors are mixtures of neoplastic and nonneoplastic cells, and the {DNA} from the nonneoplastic cells can mask {LOH}. We here describe a new experimental approach, involving two components, to overcome these problems. First, a form of digital {PCR} was employed to directly count, one by one, the number of each of the two alleles in tumor samples. Second, Bayesian-type likelihood methods were used to measure the strength of the evidence for the allele distribution being different from normal. This approach imparts a rigorous statistical basis to {LOH} analyses, and should be able to provide more reliable information than heretofore possible in {LOH} studies of diverse tumor types.},

The high gas solubility of {PDMS} is exploited to provide the built-in power of self-priming so that the sample and oil are sequentially sucked into the device to realize sample self-compartmentalization based on surface tension. The lifespan of its self-priming capability was about two weeks tested using an air-tight packaging bottle sealed with a small amount of petroleum jelly, which is significant for a practical platform. The {SPC} chip contains 5120 independent 5 {nL} microchambers, allowing the samples to be compartmentalized completely. Using this platform, three different abundances of lung cancer related genes are detected to demonstrate the feasibility and flexibility of the microchip for amplifying a single nucleic acid molecule. For maximal accuracy, within less than 5\% of the measurement deviation, the optimal number of positive chambers is between 400 and 1250 evaluated by the Poisson distribution, which means one panel can detect an average of 480 to 4804 template molecules. This device without world-to-chip connections eliminates the constraint of the complex pipeline control, and is an integrated on-chip platform, which would be a significant improvement to digital {PCR} automation and more user-friendly.},
