#' Simulate Array Digital PCR
#'
#' A function that simulates results of an array digital PCR.
#'
#' The array digital PCR is performed on plates containing many microfluidic
#' chambers with a randomly distributed DNA template, fluorescence labels and
#' standard PCR reagents. After the amplification reaction, performed
#' independently in each chamber, the chambers with the fluorescence level
#' below certain threshold are treated as negative. From differences between
#' amplification curves of positive chambers it is possible to calculate both
#' total number of template molecules and their approximate number in a
#' single chamber.
#'
#' The function contains two implementations of the array digital PCR
#' simulation. First one was described in Dube at. al (2008). This method is
#' based on random distributing \eqn{m \times times}{m * times} molecules
#' between \eqn{n \times times}{n * times} chambers.  After this step, the
#' required number of plates is created by the random sampling of chambers
#' without replacement. The above method is used, when the \code{dube} argument
#' has value \code{TRUE}.
#'
#' The second method treats the total number of template molecules as random
#' variable with a normal distribution \eqn{\mathcal{N}(n, 0.05n)}{N(n,
#' 0.05*n)}. The exact sum of total molecules per plate is calculated and
#' randomly adjusted to the value of \eqn{m \times times}{m * times}. The above
#' method is used, when the \code{dube} argument has value \code{FALSE}. This
#' implementation is much faster than previous one, especially for big
#' simulations. The higher the value of the argument \code{times}, the
#' simulation result is closer to theoretical calculations.

#' @aliases sim_adpcr
#' @param m the total number of template molecules added to the plate. Must be
#' a positive integer.
#' @param n the number of chambers per plate. Must be a positive integer.
#' @param times number of repetitions (see Details).
#' @param n_panels the number of panels that are simulated by the function.
#' Cannot have higher value than the \code{times} argument.
#' @param dube if \code{TRUE}, the function is strict implementation of array
#' digital PCR simulation (as in Dube et al., 2008). If \code{FALSE}, the
#' function calculates only approximation of Dube's experiment. See Details and
#' References.
#' @param pos_sums if \code{TRUE}, function returns only the total number of
#' positive (containing at least one molecule) chamber per panel. If
#' \code{FALSE}, the functions returns a vector of length equal to the number
#' of chambers. Each element of the vector represents the number of template
#' molecules in a given chamber.
#' @return If the \code{pos_sums} argument has value \code{FALSE}, the function
#' returns a matrix with \eqn{n} rows and \eqn{n_panels} columns. Each column
#' represents one plate. The type of such simulation would be \code{"nm"}. If the
#' \code{pos_sums} argument has value \code{TRUE}, the function returns a
#' matrix with one row and \eqn{n_panels} columns. Each column contains the
#' total number of positive chambers in each plate and type of simulation would
#' be set as \code{"tnp"}.
#'
#' In each case the value is an object of the \code{\linkS4class{adpcr}} class.
